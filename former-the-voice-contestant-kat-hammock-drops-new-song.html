Taking her place on <a href=#>Team Blake</a>, the vocalist made it all the way to the Semi-Finals before facing elimination. But this hasn’t put a damper on her artistry. Her former coach took to social media today to promote her new single “Beautiful Life” out now.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kat-hammock-releases-new-song-beautiful-life>Kat Hammock Releases New Song “Beautiful Life”</h2><p>Shelton took to Twitter as a proud coach to support his mentee. Kat released her new song “Beautiful Life” and life isn’t the only thing that’s beautiful in this song. The carefully written lyrics take listeners on a wonderful and personal journey. Kat even took time to write a Behind the Music <a href=#>blog post</a> about the song’s meaning.</p><p>Here, the singer shares that significant memories have profoundly shaped her outlook on life. Hammock reveals that reminiscing on these thoughts while in the shower began her songwriting process. In “Beautiful Life,” the artist captures some of her life’s most transitional moments. The funerals for each of her grandparents, her audition for The Voice, her first sunrise, the dark days of the pandemic, and family, are all written about in the single.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Hammock also referred to her favorite Bible verse, Psalm 30:5, while contemplating the lyrics:</p><p>“The lyrics began to pour out of me as I thought of that verse in the context of my own memories, and most of the song was written an hour later,” she shares in her <a href=#>blog post</a>. “Only a few small changes have been made to the lyrics since then. Now, nine months later, I am so excited to share it with you, and my hope is that it can lead you to contemplate the beauty of your own life as well!”</p><p>The slow and peaceful ballad is enough to bring tears to your eyes. Hammock’s classic country vocals are beautifully conveyed through her touching message in the song.</p><p>“No season lasts forever, the sun will set and it’ll rise, like a puddle in the desert, the teardrops always dry,” Hammock sings.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-kat-hammock-on-and-off-the-voice>Who is Kat Hammock? On and Off The Voice</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>On The Voice Hammock sang “Vienna” in the Blind Auditions, and turned the chairs of Shelton and <a href=#>Gwen Stefani</a> at the very last moment. In the battle rounds, she sang “Take Me Home, Country Roads” beating out Josie Jones. She won against Lauren Hall while singing “Breakaway” in the Knockout Round. On her last The Voice performance, she sang “Somewhere Only We Know.” Her elimination marked the first time since season 11 that Shelton did not have two or more artists in the finale.</p><p>The season 17 semi-finalist auditioned for The Voice when she was just 18. Hammock began singing in church in the fourth grade, learning piano shortly after. Due to her parents influence, the singer grew up on ’60s and ’70s music that inspired her love of singing.</p><p>While in middle school, she was invited to New York to sing at Carnegie Hall, opening the opportunity to sing solo at Lincoln Center on several occasions. Wetting her feet on these world-renowned stages helped her to realize she could pursue singing as a career.</p><p>In addition to being a singer, she is a recent high school graduate and part-time music teacher for kids. Along with “Beautiful Life,” Hammock has several other singles available to stream on Spotify.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-Voice-Ariana-Grande.jpeg alt="Ariana Grande Joins Season 21 of ‘The Voice’, What Will She Gift Her Team?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xaippp2iYsGpsYyvpqKblWKwsLrTnqqtmZ6peqyt02afmqWdpLCsecOrpqmrXaOyuHnSqKWgZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./grandma-and-the-man-she-mistakenly-messaged-celebrate-their-8th-year-together-816112.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Grandma and the Man She Mistakenly Messaged Celebrate Their 8th Year Together</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./everything-to-know-about-agt-9-year-old-singer-pranysqa-mishra.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Everything to Know About 'AGT' 9 Year Old Singer Pranysqa Mishra</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

We’re sorry to&nbsp;hear about what you’re going through. We’ve put together some tips that we&nbsp;hope might make things a&nbsp;bit easier for you.</p><p><h2>Consider whether he&nbsp;can change.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2c6/046/85903d5666838a9cdb6a91e142.jpg><p>Consider whether he’s capable of&nbsp;changing his behavior. It&nbsp;seems like he&nbsp;might not have strong enough feelings toward you to&nbsp;change or&nbsp;protect you from your MIL. He&nbsp;allows his mother to&nbsp;insult you and your daughter in&nbsp;your own house.</p><p>Besides, he&nbsp;witnessed it&nbsp;and still seemed fine with&nbsp;it. Decide if&nbsp;you’re ready to&nbsp;continue living your life with such a&nbsp;man by&nbsp;your side. He&nbsp;will likely avoid all kinds of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>conflicts</a>, especially around strangers, so&nbsp;you’ll always need to&nbsp;rely on&nbsp;your own support.</p><p><h2>Reconsider your relationship.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a45/7a3/d2ab1e54febe188addd73db195.jpg><p>It&nbsp;might be&nbsp;hard for you to&nbsp;<a href=# title=respect data-link=tag>respect</a> or&nbsp;trust him again, which is&nbsp;understandable. His silence means he&nbsp;agrees with what your MIL&nbsp;said. Otherwise, he&nbsp;would have said something at&nbsp;least, and not necessarily in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>offensive</a> manner.</p><p>He&nbsp;could have politely calmed her down, but he&nbsp;didn’t do&nbsp;that. For him, the so-called respect for his mother outweighed his love toward you. It’s unlikely he’ll ever change his way of&nbsp;thinking, so&nbsp;you decide whether to&nbsp;accept him or&nbsp;leave.</p><p><h2>Cut off contact with your MIL.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/109/fc4/817a765a2d8c549bee7cafee76.jpg><p>Try to&nbsp;stay <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>away</a> from your mother-in-law as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;possible. Don’t let your daughter see her, and tell your husband about&nbsp;it. After that heated conversation, he&nbsp;probably understands why you want to&nbsp;make such a&nbsp;decision.</p><p>If&nbsp;you still want to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;the relationship, avoid your MIL and don’t ask her to&nbsp;babysit anymore. Her behavior toward a&nbsp;child was aggressive, and you can’t be&nbsp;sure of&nbsp;your daughter’s safety when your MIL&nbsp;is around her.</p><p><h2>Try going to&nbsp;couples therapy.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c4f/70f/6e5953593d803ec3ef00342c5d.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you believe that your husband can change for you, try <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>couples</a> therapy. A&nbsp;qualified therapist can help your husband resolve his issues and voice his opinions without being scared of&nbsp;judgment. Right now, it&nbsp;seems like your husband can’t handle any kind of&nbsp;confrontation. Therapy can help him express his feelings and stand up&nbsp;for your <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> next time.</p><p>Marriage isn’t always a&nbsp;storybook romance, there’s always a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;work involved. However, even when we&nbsp;break off our relationships, our exes can still mess up&nbsp;our life.

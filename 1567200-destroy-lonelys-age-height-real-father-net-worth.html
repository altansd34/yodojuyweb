The <a href=#>American rapper</a> was born on 30 July 2001. Destroy Lonely’s zodiac sign is Leo.</p><p class=align-left>What is Destroy Lonely’s real name? His birth name is Bobby Wardell Sandimanie III. Bobby was born in Decatur, Georgia. He was raised by his mother and grandparents, alongside his older brother and two younger sisters. In sixth grade, he moved to the southside of Atlanta, Georgia, to live with his grandmother.</p><p class=align-left>Bobby referenced feeling lonely growing up as he hated school and was homeschooled in the sixth grade. That feeling inspired the second half of his stage name. He became a regular Xanax user in high school and would go to school intoxicated every morning. He soon realised he would destroy himself if he didn’t change, which inspired the first half of his stage name.</p><h2>Who is Destroy Lonely's dad?</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/49fb8b85ff2e775f.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Anti Da Menace’s age, height, real name, birthday, hometown</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e87677ca02f51d88.png><p class=align-left>His father is rapper I-20, born Bobby Wardell Sandimanie II.

Since the early 2000s, I-20 has worked with producer DJ Pain 1.</p><p class=align-left>Lonely has been vocal about distancing himself from his father’s career and rejecting the “nepo baby” tag. In a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><i>Paper Magazine</i> interview</a>, he elaborated that calling him a “nepo baby” would be unfounded. He never lived with his father, and I-20 never helped him with his music or encouraged him until 2022. Additionally, his style is entirely different from his father’s.</p><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>Lonely started rapping at 14, experimenting by making tracks on his computer.

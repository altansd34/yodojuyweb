Since this premiere, it has had a record high 35-day audience growth. Since its debut on September 26, the show has nearly doubled its audience, reaching a remarkable 8.4 million total viewers after 35 days of multiplatform viewing, as reported by the network.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-here-s-why-dwts-viewership-is-rising-for-season-32>Here’s Why DWTS Viewership is Rising For Season 32</h2><p>This surge in viewership is a significant leap from its same-day broadcast audience, which initially gathered around 4.8 million viewers. However, with the added complexity of simulcasting on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney+</a>, the exact number of viewers on the premiere night remains a bit elusive.</p><p>The show’s appeal seems to have transcended the traditional television landscape, leaving fans curious about the reach and impact of the Disney+ audience. The ratings tell a compelling story as well, with the episode securing a 1.6 rating among adults 18-49.</p><p>This marks an impressive 150% increase from the live + same-day rating. ABC proudly boasts that these delayed-viewing increases are the best the series has ever experienced. The positive trajectory for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> became evident when the show returned to ABC after a season exclusively on Disney+. Although viewership numbers for Season 31 were not disclosed, the decision to return to ABC hints at the possibility of addressing lower audience figures.</p><p>Upon its ABC comeback this season, the series garnered 6.5 million viewers in the first three days. This figure closely mirrors the audience size for the Season 30 premiere in 2021. ABC now asserts that the Season 32 premiere has outperformed its preceding ABC outing, boasting an 11 percent increase in the MP35 window compared to 2021. Additionally, the show has grown by 3 percent in the coveted 18-49 demographic.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-dwts-season-32-premiere-is-highly-favorable-compared-to-season-31>The DWTS Season 32 Premiere is Highly Favorable Compared to Season 31</h2><p>The return of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> in Season 32 has sparked highly favorable opinions among fans. Season 32’s kickoff showcased praiseworthy performances, prompting higher views. However, when compared to the previous season’s lukewarm reception, this premiere seemed to elevate the show’s appeal.</p><p>The previous season witnessed a decline in viewership for DWTS. The choice of celebrities, ranging from influencers to B-list actors, drew both intrigue and skepticism from audiences.</p><p>With the premiere receiving a positive rating of 4 out of 5 stars, the season’s potential shines through despite the weaknesses observed in the previous year. As the competition unfolds, audiences eagerly anticipate whether the show can elevate itself even more than it already has.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Original_KalaniHilliker_JoJoSiwa_Amy-Sussman_Getty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="JoJo Siwa Addresses Relationship Rumors With Former ‘Dance Moms’ Costar Kalani Hilliker" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w5qlnKGenHq4tdOhZK2glWLAta3RrGSsnZGovK95kmtkoZmjYr%2Bmr86rm2agmZy1bn%2BUZpuasV2WwqW1xKeanmWXp7y4wMdo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-x-factor-usa-secures-nbc-revival-but-should-it-return.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'The X Factor USA' Secures NBC Revival, But Should it Return?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1473566-man-uses-chocolate-build-girraffe-animal-video-shows-it.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Will He Later Eat It?

Although she was young, she took to the stage with loads of confidence and an impressive singing voice. Heavenly Joy’s audition quickly went viral, so what is she up to in 2022?</strong></p><p>Heavenly Joy appeared in America’s Got Talent season 10 in 2015. Even though it seems like 2015 was not too long ago, this young singer is now 12 years old. She is pretty inactive on her YouTube, but she can be seen on her Instagram.</p><p>It seems like she still is quite the singer to this day. Heavenly Joy is the daughter of Grammy Award winning music producer Rodney Jerkins and singer Joy Enriquez.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/tv/CQ6TUUjHyVh/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-will-heavenly-joy-have-her-acting-debut-this-summer>Will Heavenly Joy Have Her Acting Debut This Summer?</h2><p>Heavenly Joy’s most recent career update is that she was apart of the song “<a href=#>Come Together</a>” produced by her father. This uplifting song features multiple other singers like Heavenly Joy’s mom. For many, this was their first time hearing Heavenly Joy’s voice since AGT. People were once again shocked to hear how powerful her voice is.</p><p>We also know she may be in an upcoming movie. After her time on America’s Got Talent she worked on an animated film named Blazing Samurai. In 2016 the singer shared a photo with Samuel L. Jackson to let her fans know that she finished up her lines in the studio. Blazing Samurai has yet to make it to theaters.</p><p>The original release planned for this film was in 2017, then the original production company shut down. Since then, this film has been handed around until it found it’s recent home at Paramount Pictures. Paramount Pictures will premiere Blazing Samurai on July 22, 2022.</p><p>This is great news, but Heavenly Joy’s name is not apart of the previewed cast list. Although this is not the end all be all, at one production company both the directors and producers were replaced, so this movie could have changed a lot in the past few years. Samuel L. Jackson is still on the cast list, so we’re hoping Heavenly Joy’s voice is still used.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Heavenly Joy’s Career Before America’s Got Talent</h2><p>Before ever stepping foot on the AGT stage, Heavenly Joy had already made her television debut. In 2013, she was in her family’s reality television show, House of Joy. The series featured the young singers entire family, with an emphasis on her parents. Even at three years old, Heavenly Joy was seen mentioning that she wanted to become a singer on this series.</p><p>From there, Heavenly Joy went on to give one of the most iconic kid performances on America’s Got Talent to date. She took to the stage with her hair in pigtails and a giant smile on her face. The judges were first taken aback by her ability to have such a large personality, but they were totally jaw dropped when she started singing and tap dancing. This girl had loads of talent for only five years old. In her audition she sang “In Summer” from Frozen. It was a unanimous decision to send adorable Heavenly Joy into the next round of the competition.</p><p>Heavenly Joy did not perform in the judge cuts. To this day, fans are unsure of if Heavenly Joy withdrew from the competition or was cut by the judges behind the scenes. Regardless, her career didn’t end there. Nearly days before her sixth birthday Heavenly Joy appeared on Little Big Shots with Steve Harvey. On this series, Heavenly Joy showed off her impressive talent and natural comedic ways. Since then, the young singer has sang at events like the Republican National Convention, <a href=#>holiday concerts</a>, <a href=#>alongside her mom on stage</a>, and more.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NUP_193480_6678.jpg alt="Need a Laugh?

But what about the other most spoken languages in France? Like most French learners, you probably don’t think about languages besides French when you think of France. However, France has a number of<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;regional languages</a></strong>&nbsp;and immigrant communities who speak other languages.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=France’s-regional-languages>France’s&nbsp;regional languages</h2><p>Though local<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;indigenous languages</a></strong>&nbsp;have long been pushed out, you’ll still hear many of them spoken across various regions in France. Along France’s border with Spain, you might come across Catalan or you might hear a bit of Breton spoken in northern France.</p><p>Some communities are even working to revitalize these local languages and dialects. For instance, in the French region of Corsica, there is a push to make Corsican a co-official language.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Occitan</h3><p>The most widely spoken regional language in France is Occitan, also known as “langue d’oc”. It’s spoken in the southern region of the country and can also be found in Italy and Spain.</p><p>Occitan has six major dialects: Provençal (the dialect found in southern France), Gascon, Languedocien, Limousin, Alpine and Auvergne.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Alsatian</h3><p>If you’re traveling to the Alsace region of France bordering Switzerland and Germany, you might come across the country’s second most widely spoken regional language: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alsatian</a>. It also has a number of different dialects and is mostly spoken by older generations.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Immigrant-communities-in-France>Immigrant communities in France</h2><p>In addition to France’s many regional languages, there are a number of immigrant communities in France, especially in Paris.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Arabic</h3><p>France currently has a significant number of Arabic-speaking immigrants from North Africa, making Arabic the most widely spoken minority language in France.</p><p>If you’ve ever studied Arabic, you probably know that it has a few distinct dialects. In France, you’ll most likely find Maghrebi Arabic being spoken as many Arabic-speaking immigrants come from Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Other-languages-in-France>Other languages in France</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>German</h3><p>France’s Alsace region borders Germany and Switzerland. Naturally, if you spend some time there, you’re more likely to hear a bit of German. In the city of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Strasbourg</a>, you’ll even find some street signs with both French and German names.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>English</h3><p>How far will&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">speaking English</a></strong>&nbsp;get you in France?</p><p>In some places, like Paris, you might be able to get by, especially in tourist-heavy areas. However, if you approach someone without at least trying to speak French, you’ll easily come across as rude.</p><p>Many French people also learn some English in school. So, if it seems like you’re struggling to&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">speak French</a></strong>, they’re often willing to try speaking English with you.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Italian and Spanish</h3><p>In southern France, you might also come across a bit of Italian in the French Alps, as well as&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish</a></strong>&nbsp;near bordering Spain. So, if you’re comfortable speaking either of these, it may come in handy on a trip to Southern France.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Did any of these languages surprise you?</h2><p>Keep in mind that the French will always appreciate it if you speak to them in French first. However, if you find yourself in an area where another language is widely spoken, you could end up speaking something other than French.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/lingoda-2020-favicon.png><h2>Cassie Wright</h2><p>Cassie Wright is a freelance writer and blogger living in the United States. After a bad experience with elementary school Spanish classes, she fell in love with learning French. Now, in addition to French, she spends a considerable amount of time learning Japanese and has jumped back into learning Spanish. Like many avid language learners, she plans to continue learning more languages than she has hours in the day. When she isn’t writing or learning, she loves reading, traveling, video games, and all forms of chocolate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXNoKadmV6YvK57waWmoGeVo3y4tMicn2aZopp6tbTEZqSoq6RiwLG7yp6lZqSRo7S2rcaeqmahnmKzs63NnJxo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1149203-what-a-shape-sides-called-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is a shape with eight sides called?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./watch-bret-michaelss-special-the-masked-singer-performance.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>WATCH Bret Michaels's Special 'The Masked Singer' Performance</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

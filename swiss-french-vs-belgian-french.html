What is even crazier is that within the same language, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">French</a>, there are many differences between these two countries, yet they are so close to each other. Here are my tips for recognizing the differences between Swiss French and Belgian French.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Start your journey to reach fluency</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Beg your pardon?</h2><p>As a Frenchwoman, I love Belgian humor and films with Benoît Poelvoorde or François Damiens. On the Swiss side, I was dazzled by&nbsp;Ma vie de Courgette, an animated film. You can watch these films just like me without any problem because the French are very similar. Likewise, in writing, if you consult Belgian or Swiss websites, you will not see the difference… unless suddenly, there is a number or an expression typically local, and there you will say&nbsp;Hein? Quoi?&nbsp;Beg your pardon?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Swiss-French-vs.-Belgian-French:-The-numbers>Swiss French vs. Belgian French: The numbers</h2><p>Belgian and Swiss are more logical than the<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;French concerning numbers</a>.</strong>&nbsp;The madness begins with the number 70. In France, 70 is an addition: 60 + 10 =&nbsp;soixante-dix, and 90 is a multiplication followed by an addition: 4 x 20 + 10:&nbsp;quatre-vingt-dix! In Belgium and Switzerland, 70 and 90 are numbers that respect the Latin root:&nbsp;septante&nbsp;and&nbsp;nonante. However, the Belgians, with their picky humor, have left traps with the number 80, they say like the French:&nbsp;quatre-vingt… That gives&nbsp;septante&nbsp;(70),&nbsp;quatre-vingt&nbsp;(80) and&nbsp;nonante&nbsp;(90). On the contrary, the Swiss are consistent with the numerical logic and say&nbsp;septante&nbsp;(70),&nbsp;huitante&nbsp;(80) and&nbsp;nonante&nbsp;(90)! Even if sometimes, as in Neuchâtel, some people also say&nbsp;quatre-vingt… What a headache!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Different-expressions-in-Swiss-and-Belgian-French>Different expressions in Swiss and Belgian French</h2><p>While I was talking with Swiss and/or Belgians, I stopped many times to ask them:&nbsp;Hein? Quoi?&nbsp;What did you say? I needed a decoder while we were speaking the same language!&nbsp; Now, let’s talk about the most recurrent and funny expressions, but know that there is a beautiful anthology!</p><p>One of the most common conversations (as with many cultures) is about the weather. But beware! With the Belgians, if it rains heavily, they will say&nbsp;il drache&nbsp;while the Swiss will say&nbsp;il roille&nbsp;(pronounce it “roy”). If it is cold, you will hear the Belgians say&nbsp;il fait caillant&nbsp;while the Swiss say like the French spoken in France:&nbsp;ça caille.</p><p>Belgians and their beers are&nbsp;bons vivants&nbsp;and have many expressions to say they drink a bottomless drink:&nbsp;afonner&nbsp;(to see the bottom “le fond” of the glass) or drink a lot:&nbsp;se prendre une douffe. To say that they are celebrating, the Belgians will say:&nbsp;faire la guindaille&nbsp;while the Swiss will say:&nbsp;faire la noce.</p><p>Imagine you are getting to know a Swiss man/woman, and he/she asks you for your&nbsp;Natel&nbsp;number,&nbsp;Hein? Quoi?&nbsp;Natel&nbsp;for the Swiss is their mobile phone, it is a portmanteau word that comes from “National” and “Autotelefon”. Belgians will prefer&nbsp;GSM&nbsp;to write down your number!</p><p><h2 class=headline>Start your journey to reach fluency</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-to-ask-questions-in-Swiss-or-Belgian-French>How to ask questions in Swiss or Belgian French</h2><p>Belgians have the specificity to confuse the verbs&nbsp;savoir&nbsp;and&nbsp;pouvoir. They can easily ask you:&nbsp;sais-tu lire mon numéro?&nbsp;(do you know how to read my number?) instead of:&nbsp;peux-tu lire mon numéro? (can you/are you able to read my number?).</p><p>The Swiss will tend to finish all their questions with&nbsp;ou bien, as an audible question mark to ask for a choice or its opposite. It is used in many, many situations. Sometimes you may find yourself hearing it three times in two sentences in a row.</p><p>Ça va ou bien ? = Ça va ou ça va pas ?&nbsp;(Are you okay or not?)</p><p>Tu as mangé ou bien ? = Tu as mangé ou pas ?&nbsp;(Have you eaten or not?)</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Pronunciation-differences>Pronunciation differences</h2><p>Finally, what will allow you to distinguish the two French-speaking countries is their pronunciation.</p><p>The Swiss have a reputation for speaking slowly, but the real difference lies in the emphasis on their words and sentences. While French in France insists on the last syllable of words and sentences, Swiss French emphasizes the penultimate one.</p><p>Among Belgians, it will be more a question of certain consonants which are very strongly accentuated (the “r” very guttural) or directly exchanged (the[d] becomes[t], as in “grande” pronounces “grant’”) or a set of vowels pronounced&nbsp;oui&nbsp;as in&nbsp;huit&nbsp;(eight) pronounced&nbsp;ouite&nbsp;or&nbsp;cuisine&nbsp;(kitchen) pronounced&nbsp;couisine.</p><p>Despite all these differences, the Belgians and the Swiss will agree on one thing: chocolate!</p><p><h2 class=headline>Start your journey to reach fluency</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Audrey-Sivadier-1.png><h2>Audrey Sivadier</h2><p>Audrey has been a French teacher for more than ten years now, and a cheese-lover all her life. She comes from the west of France, and after living 2 years in Spain and 4 years in Oxford in England, she has just settled in the heart of France, in Auvergne, a land of cheese, rugby, Michelin tires and ancient volcanoes. Audrey definitely prefers the first one. She speaks French, Spanish and English, and just started German, nothing better to understand her students who tremble at the French grammar! When she is not teaching, she tries to find time to cook or sing in a choir. She loves to invite people to her house to feed them and trap them with musical blind tests designed and adapted to her guests!

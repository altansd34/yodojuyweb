The couple has been dating for over two years, and Scherzinger has <a href=#>called Evans “the man of my dreams.”</a></strong> <strong>You might be wondering exactly who Evans is and how the couple met.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nichole-scherzinger-met-boyfriend-thom-evans-on-x-factor>Nichole Scherzinger Met Boyfriend Thom Evans on ‘X Factor’</h2><p>In October 2019, Evans competed on The X Factor: Celebrity. He was a member of the group Try Star, along with fellow rugby stars Levi Davis and Ben Foden. The group finished the competition in fifth place, but Evans still walked away with something special.</p><p>Scherzinger was a judge on the show, alongside Simon Cowell and Louis Walsh. Evans’ group mates teased him about the possibility of a romance between him and Scherzinger. Cowell pointed out that he had never seen Scherzinger smile like she did about Try Star’s performances.</p><p>The couple was first spotted together in November 2019, and they made their red carpet debut in January 2020. Scherzinger said in an interview afterward, “I couldn’t be happier right now, and I’m really grateful.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-evans-is-a-former-rugby-player>Evans Is a Former Rugby Player</h3><p>Evans is a former rugby player who competed with the Glasgow Warriors in the Celtic League until a neck injury forced him to retire from the sport in 2010. The star is 36 years old, having been born in Harare, Zimbabwe, in 1985.</p><p>After retiring from rugby, Evans chose to go into sprinting. He finished fourth in the Scottish Senior Championships in 2012, having been coached by Margot Wells. Evans soon chose to end his athletic career entirely and focus on a career in entertainment.</p><p>However, even though he’s no longer competing, fitness is still important to him. In fact, he and Scherzinger frequently post exercise videos together on Instagram. Evans has also pursued acting, even auditioning for the role of Christian Grey in Fifty Shades of Grey.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# class=broken_link>NICOLE SCHERZINGER AND THOM EVANS DOUBLE DATE WITH SIMON COWELL AND LAUREN SILVERMAN AFTER BIKE ACCIDENT</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-star-is-no-stranger-to-talent-shows>The Star Is No Stranger to Talent Shows</h3><p>X Factor: Celebrity is not the only talent show Evans has competed on over the years. In 2014, he competed on Strictly Come Dancing, making it to the fifth week of competition. Then in 2016, he appeared on Celebrity Island with Bear Grylls.</p><p>Evans said in an interview last year that he <a href=#>“hit the jackpot”</a> in his relationship with Scherzinger, calling the 43-year-old Pussycat Dolls star “so easy and fun to be around.” He initially thought Scherzinger was out of his league.</p><p>“It was only after we sang an awkward performance of Swing Low, Sweet Chariot and she kindly saved us in the show that we as a band went up to her dressing room to thank her,” he recalled. “That was the first time I met her and I’ve never looked back.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1373217625.jpg alt="Ariana DeBose: From ‘So You Think You Can Dance’ to the SAG Awards" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGmZqGjYruqr86lnGark52ys8bIp56eqqNir7DFxaugnqaUYrqmsdNmqa6fkq56tMDAq2StoJ%2BieqbCwKeqaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./35619-who-supports-abolishing-devolved-parliaments-and-w.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who supports abolishing the devolved parliaments, and why?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./we-chose-my-late-moms-name-for-our-baby-but-my-husband-secretly-changed-it-819878.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>We Chose My Late Moms Name for Our Baby, But My Husband Secretly Changed It</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

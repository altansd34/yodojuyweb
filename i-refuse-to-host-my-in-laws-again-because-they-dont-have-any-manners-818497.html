A&nbsp;woman was put into an&nbsp;uncomfortable situation by&nbsp;her in-laws’ behavior when they came to&nbsp;visit. And due to&nbsp;their rudeness, she decided to&nbsp;refuse hosting them again.</p><h2>A&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>woman</a> came into a&nbsp;conflict with her in-laws because of&nbsp;their rude behavior.</h2><p>My&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I finally bought our first house, 5bd/3bth, a&nbsp;year ago. Over the holidays, we&nbsp;thought we’d take on&nbsp;the role of&nbsp;hosting a&nbsp;few get-togethers.</p><p>From my&nbsp;perspective, it&nbsp;was hell. I&nbsp;hated every second of&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;never really hosted anything or&nbsp;«entertained» or&nbsp;whatever you want to&nbsp;call&nbsp;it. Maybe it’s just that I’m not used to&nbsp;the requirements. But growing&nbsp;up, my&nbsp;mom or&nbsp;dad would host family, and they were nothing like this. My&nbsp;in-laws did things like:</p><ul><li>Let kids run around screaming/yelling, up&nbsp;and down stairs, touching things that didn’t belong to&nbsp;them, making messes and not making them clean up&nbsp;after themselves.</li><li>Parents didn’t bring anything for the kids to&nbsp;do&nbsp;and got pissy with&nbsp;us for not having anything for them.</li><li>Brought a&nbsp;dog into our house, let the dog on&nbsp;the furniture</li><li>Left chairs sticking out of&nbsp;tables/counters instead of&nbsp;pushing them in</li><li>Stomped around the house with their shoes on&nbsp;despite being asked to&nbsp;remove them</li><li>Left trash/paper plates etc sitting around or&nbsp;balled up&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;placing it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the trash</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1ee/f38/7522db542b84d62cba954221a7.jpg><ul><li>Opened multiple bottles/cans of&nbsp;drinks and only took a&nbsp;sip and left it&nbsp;open</li><li>Pulled out and used new rolls of&nbsp;toilet paper when there was still plenty left on&nbsp;the rolls</li><li>Opened medicine cabinets</li><li>Only one person asked if&nbsp;we&nbsp;needed help at&nbsp;any point, and it&nbsp;was my&nbsp;husband’s brother’s new girlfriend, who we&nbsp;were all meeting for the first time. She offered to&nbsp;help&nbsp;us clean&nbsp;up, bring out food, etc.</li></ul><p>This was a&nbsp;terrible experience. My&nbsp;husband was shocked at&nbsp;his family’s behavior and didn’t know what to&nbsp;say. I&nbsp;don’t blame him for this at&nbsp;all. He&nbsp;was just a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the hosting as&nbsp;me, but he&nbsp;was seeing his family through new eyes as&nbsp;well.</p><p>When he&nbsp;talked to&nbsp;his mom and dad after, they just laughed at&nbsp;us and said, «That’s what hosting&nbsp;is.» So, we&nbsp;decided together we&nbsp;would rather not go&nbsp;through all that again. When Easter was coming&nbsp;up, my&nbsp;in-laws asked what our plans are. My&nbsp;husband said that we&nbsp;aren’t going to&nbsp;host after everyone’s awful manners.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e7a/8b3/09caf757cb9f073dcbcb24fed0.jpg><p>His mom and dad are upset with&nbsp;us. We&nbsp;have the big house, so&nbsp;they figured it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;on&nbsp;us from now&nbsp;on. We&nbsp;said that the only way we&nbsp;would ever even consider hosting is&nbsp;if&nbsp;every member of&nbsp;his family pitched in&nbsp;some way. They said that defeats the purpose of&nbsp;someone else hosting, and that no&nbsp;one should be&nbsp;expected to&nbsp;pitch in&nbsp;if&nbsp;we&nbsp;offer to&nbsp;host. So&nbsp;we&nbsp;said we&nbsp;won’t host.</p><p>Maybe I’m just not meant to&nbsp;host. But are we&nbsp;truly so&nbsp;far out of&nbsp;bounds to&nbsp;refuse to&nbsp;host anymore because of&nbsp;how his family behaves?</p><p><h2>Redditors were all on&nbsp;the woman’s side.</h2></p><ul><li>«Your house, your rules. And if&nbsp;people are ignoring those rules, then&nbsp;I think it’s fair not to&nbsp;host.<br>But what really gets me&nbsp;is&nbsp;the shoe thing. It’s super common in&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;cultures not to&nbsp;wear shoes in&nbsp;the house. It’s something you should expect and <a href=# title=respect data-link=tag>respect</a> when going to&nbsp;someone else’s house. It’s such a&nbsp;baseline boundary that to&nbsp;disregard it&nbsp;is&nbsp;ABSURD.<br>What are you getting out of&nbsp;it&nbsp;to&nbsp;ignore that rule? A&nbsp;petty sense of&nbsp;control? I&nbsp;could deal with the chairs, and even the messes, but if&nbsp;people went out of&nbsp;their way to&nbsp;spite the house rules for absolutely no&nbsp;reason, I&nbsp;wouldn’t invite them back either. If&nbsp;they can’t respect something as&nbsp;basic as&nbsp;no&nbsp;shoes, they don’t have an&nbsp;iota of&nbsp;respect for you or&nbsp;your husband.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Bureaucratic_D***&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>«I&nbsp;loved hosting, we&nbsp;love our home—having the kids playing in&nbsp;the pool, cooking for our family is&nbsp;our way of&nbsp;showing love for people. BUT, we&nbsp;had to&nbsp;stop.<br>EVERY TIME they came over, something was broken...blinds had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;re-tightened, doorknobs had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;put back&nbsp;on, scratch marks on&nbsp;the hardwood floors, huge oil stains in&nbsp;the driveway, and worst of&nbsp;all, one family member had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;watched at&nbsp;all times due to&nbsp;their stealing habits.<br>It&nbsp;was too much and we&nbsp;said no&nbsp;more. Every year after, one sibling kept trying to&nbsp;hold events at&nbsp;my&nbsp;house, and&nbsp;I shut that talk down.

That’s because there’s always a&nbsp;chance that viewers and directors will mistake their good performance for real life, forever labeling them as&nbsp;“that bad guy.” This is&nbsp;exactly what happened to&nbsp;some of&nbsp;the actors from our article&nbsp;— great performers who portrayed their characters in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;believable way that everyone around them forgot what they were like before.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> were really curious to&nbsp;find out what kinds of&nbsp;characters actors played before they were labeled as&nbsp;villains. We&nbsp;had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;fun looking through old photos from their time on&nbsp;film and&nbsp;TV.</p><p><h2>Anthony Hopkins</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ca7/5b5/8adb9b5a92b400e84ae1b883b6.jpg><p><a href=# title="Anthony Hopkins" data-link=tag>Anthony Hopkins</a> has had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;really cool roles. He’s proven that he&nbsp;can be&nbsp;both the good guy and the really bad guy. But he&nbsp;became famous when he&nbsp;landed the part of&nbsp;Hannibal Lecter in&nbsp;The Silence of&nbsp;the Lambs. His facial expressions and crazy eyes with perfect manners sent chills down everyone’s spines. It’s not surprising that this work <a href=#>won</a> Hopkins an&nbsp;Academy Award.</p><p>It’s worth noting that Anthony Hopkins used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>stage</a> performer before he&nbsp;<a href=#>started</a> his mainstream acting career at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;23, in&nbsp;<a href=#>1960</a>. His first memorable role was as&nbsp;Prince Richard in&nbsp;The Lion in&nbsp;Winter.</p><p><h2>Robert Englund</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/391/192/40865a5442a88f0075ceed7b57.jpg><p>Freddy Krueger became the biggest childhood nightmare for many of&nbsp;us. The cunning villain with scary scars all over his body who didn’t understand the meaning of&nbsp;“mercy” was named <a href=#>iconic</a> by&nbsp;many movie critics. Freddy was portrayed by&nbsp;actor Robert Englund. He&nbsp;has done quite a&nbsp;few roles in&nbsp;horror films like Wishmaster, The Midnight Man, Lake Placid, and others.</p><p>Englund <a href=#>started</a> his acting career in&nbsp;1973 and he’s still an&nbsp;actor. However, he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;turn down the opportunity to&nbsp;play Freddie again. He&nbsp;<a href=#>thinks</a> that he’s too old for a&nbsp;role like that. He’s portrayed Freddie in&nbsp;8&nbsp;movies.</p><p><h2>Eva Green</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/36b/7d7/691c60554a9bfe31cac53d885a.jpg><p>Eva Green played the part of&nbsp;Angelique Bouchard in&nbsp;Tim Burton’s Dark Shadows. But despite all of&nbsp;the crazy things her character did in&nbsp;the film, it&nbsp;was still hard to&nbsp;hate her. She was so&nbsp;charming and seductive that it&nbsp;was very difficult to&nbsp;look away from the screen.</p><p>The 39-year-old actress has played around 25&nbsp;<a href=#>roles</a> in&nbsp;movies and&nbsp;TV series. It’s important to&nbsp;note that Green is&nbsp;also capable of&nbsp;portraying positive characters in&nbsp;very convincing ways.</p><p><h2>Jason Isaacs</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/911/d05/b7ddd85d789e0308f6cf2eb92d.jpg><p>Jason Isaacs is&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor that managed to&nbsp;portray <a href=#>bad</a> guys that everyone hated. He&nbsp;was Captain Hook in&nbsp;<a href=#>Peter Pan</a>, Lucius Malfoy in&nbsp;<a href=#>Harry Potter</a>, and the merciless scientist in&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV series, <a href=#>The OA</a>.</p><p>The actor himself makes a&nbsp;far more positive impression than his famous characters. He&nbsp;takes <a href=#>part</a> in&nbsp;charity organizations, has fun in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the camera, and <a href=#>supports</a> having good relationships with his on-screen son, Tom Felton.</p><p><h2>Tom Hiddleston</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/70b/ad8/6a9633598bbac4183cc6f10e46.jpg><p>The god of&nbsp;deceit from The Avengers became the antagonist that stole some of&nbsp;the spotlight from his positive counterparts. And it’s not that surprising: very few villains are as&nbsp;charming as&nbsp;Tom Hiddleston’s Loki.</p><p>Hiddleston started appearing on-screen in&nbsp;2001 and in&nbsp;the beginning, he&nbsp;<a href=#>appeared</a> only on&nbsp;TV series and made-for-TV-movies. At&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;his career, he&nbsp;looked like a&nbsp;regular curly-haired guy. He&nbsp;only got the role of&nbsp;the god 10&nbsp;years after his first appearance on&nbsp;TV.</p><p><h2>Jessica Lange</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/80c/b10/f6b97d5397ac53ffdbe33f3945.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the 1970s, Jessica Lange was very popular because she <a href=#>played</a> the main role in&nbsp;the famous King Kong film. For some time, the actress was only associated with this role, even though she’d also had some other big roles.</p><p>Lange became popular again after 2011 when she starred in&nbsp;American Horror Story. In&nbsp;the second season of&nbsp;the show, Lange got the part of&nbsp;head of&nbsp;the psychiatric facility, <a href=#>Briarcliff</a>. Even though she portrayed a&nbsp;villain, she was really appealing to&nbsp;audiences.</p><p><h2>Alfred Molina</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a61/850/0fcb8f597291708d5544fdaa43.jpg><p>Alfred Molina gave his face to&nbsp;Doctor Octopus that was one of&nbsp;the main antagonists of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Spider-Man data-link=tag>Spider-Man</a>. This was the role that made him famous for many people. But the actor has <a href=#>more</a> than 200 films and&nbsp;TV series, some of&nbsp;which are iconic, like Chocolat, Frida, Identity.</p><p>At&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;his career, Molina appeared in&nbsp;Raiders of&nbsp;the Lost Ark where he&nbsp;played the part of&nbsp;Satipo.</p><p><h2>Andrew Scott</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bbd/d2d/0697b8592ab018ba60d6b60b82.jpg><p>Moriarty from the&nbsp;TV series <a href=#>Sherlock</a> is&nbsp;likely another villain that people absolutely loved instead of&nbsp;hated. He&nbsp;was portrayed by&nbsp;actor Andrew Scott, who has more than <a href=#>60</a>&nbsp;roles under his belt.</p><p>Sherlock is&nbsp;not the only popular project Scott has appeared&nbsp;in. You can also see him in&nbsp;movies like Saving Private Ryan, Spectre, Alice Through the Looking Glass, 1917, and more.</p><p><h2>Kathy Bates</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1c7/036/24a44355528f09ea50eb154b93.jpg><p>Kathy Bates has done quite a&nbsp;few successful films in&nbsp;her life. For example, Titanic, Midnight in&nbsp;Paris, and the&nbsp;TV series we’ve already mentioned, American Horror Story. But if&nbsp;we&nbsp;had to&nbsp;choose her biggest role, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;the main character in&nbsp;Misery that Bates won an&nbsp;Oscar for.</p><p>At&nbsp;the time, Kathy Bates was a&nbsp;fresh face for many people. She impressed many who had never heard of&nbsp;her before. Most people were surprised to&nbsp;<a href=#>find out</a> that she had appeared in&nbsp;more than 20&nbsp;movies and&nbsp;TV series before starring in&nbsp;Misery.</p><p><h2>Josh Brolin</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fdd/49d/24da565c9690862ec97262e833.jpg><p>Josh Brolin is&nbsp;not the only actor that played Thanos in&nbsp;Marvel films. Before Brolin, it&nbsp;was <a href=#>Damion Poitier</a> who had the role. But it&nbsp;was Brolin that made the antagonist appealing to&nbsp;so&nbsp;many viewers.</p><p>The Avengers was not the first successful film that Josh appeared&nbsp;in. Before that, he<a href=#>&nbsp;took part</a> in&nbsp;the iconic No&nbsp;Country for Old Men. But his acting career started back in&nbsp;1985. One of&nbsp;the first movies he&nbsp;appeared in&nbsp;was the&nbsp;TV series, The Young Riders, where Brolin played the main role.</p><p>What famous villain did you like so&nbsp;much that you couldn’t imagine the actor playing anything else?

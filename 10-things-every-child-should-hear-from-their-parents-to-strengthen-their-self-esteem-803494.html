Their childhood will be&nbsp;the perfect time to&nbsp;start encouraging them and giving them the necessary tools so&nbsp;that, ultimately, they can achieve everything they set their minds&nbsp;to. By&nbsp;reinforcing their self-esteem and helping them to&nbsp;trust themselves and manage their <a href=# title=emotions data-link=tag>emotions</a>, they will be&nbsp;ready when the time comes to&nbsp;face the “adult world” with courage and determination.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> compiled the most powerful positive reinforcement phrases you can use with your kids on&nbsp;a&nbsp;daily basis to&nbsp;help them develop golden self-esteem.</p><p><h2>1. “You can count on&nbsp;me” or&nbsp;“I’m here to&nbsp;help you”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/063/0f9/4f214358f4bbbc5333b33fed95.jpg><p>Whenever you see that your little ones doubt themselves or&nbsp;want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;something, but they can’t seem to&nbsp;get the courage to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it —either because they don’t know how to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;or&nbsp;because they are afraid— remind them that you are there for them. Let them know that they can count on&nbsp;you and that <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>they have your support</a> and your help if&nbsp;needed. Just knowing that you are there for them will encourage them to&nbsp;try and they may succeed, even if&nbsp;you don’t have to&nbsp;help them.</p><p>That is&nbsp;why it&nbsp;is&nbsp;vitally important for children to&nbsp;feel that they can <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>count on</a>&nbsp;their parents whenever they have a&nbsp;problem. This kind of&nbsp;phrase, besides reinforcing the bond and trust between parents and children, will also give children a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;security and self-confidence. These phrases will help them to&nbsp;avoid fear, knowing that if&nbsp;“something bad” happens, mom and dad will be&nbsp;there to&nbsp;protect them or&nbsp;help them.</p><p>By&nbsp;learning and practicing these attitudes from infancy, their growth and development will be&nbsp;easier, especially later in&nbsp;life when they begin to&nbsp;deal with more serious situations.</p><p><h2>2. “Tell&nbsp;me” or&nbsp;“I’m listening”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8d0/2ed/7abb0c5313a8312b70e7e75afd.jpg><p>This sentence is&nbsp;closely linked to&nbsp;the previous one, we&nbsp;can’t say “I’m here” if, later, when they want to&nbsp;tell&nbsp;us something, we&nbsp;don’t have time to&nbsp;listen. That sends a&nbsp;completely opposite message: “I’m not here,” “I&nbsp;don’t have time for you.” The moment your child wants to&nbsp;share something with you is&nbsp;the best time to&nbsp;show them that <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>you are really there</a>.</p><p>Stop what you are doing, for you it&nbsp;will only be&nbsp;a&nbsp;few minutes, but for your children, it&nbsp;will mean that you care and that they can count on&nbsp;you. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Listen</a> carefully, don’t make fun of&nbsp;their story or&nbsp;downplay its importance. If&nbsp;they wanted to&nbsp;share it&nbsp;with you, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;because it&nbsp;is&nbsp;important to&nbsp;them. Don’t interrupt them. If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;give your opinion or&nbsp;add something, wait until they finish.</p><p>What you can do&nbsp;is&nbsp;show interest and excitement in&nbsp;what they tell you: “Really?,” “Wow,” “Amazing,” children <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> this. This is&nbsp;an&nbsp;ideal way to&nbsp;start building good <a href=# title=communication data-link=tag>communication</a> with your children and reinforce their confidence in&nbsp;you. Then, as&nbsp;they get older, they will want to&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;share their experiences and concerns with you.</p><p><h2>3. “I&nbsp;love you very much” or&nbsp;simply “I&nbsp;love you”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/171/19f/48dde85f29b0576fb8c6511b47.jpg><p>We&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;them, look after them, pay for their education, arrange their after-school classes, buy them everything they need, and even don’t sleep a&nbsp;wink when we&nbsp;are worried about them. All this and more simply because we&nbsp;love them and they are the most important thing in&nbsp;our lives. However, for a&nbsp;child, reaching this conclusion is&nbsp;not as&nbsp;simple. That is&nbsp;why specialists recommend that, in&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;showing children our love through our actions, we&nbsp;should also do&nbsp;it&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>verbally</a>.</p><p>These 2&nbsp;phrases are extremely powerful&nbsp;— a&nbsp;positive reinforcement with multiple <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>benefits</a>:</p><ul><li>It&nbsp;strengthens the bond between parents and children and improves family communication.</li><li>It&nbsp;gives children confidence and peace of&nbsp;mind, as&nbsp;they feel surrounded by&nbsp;love.</li><li>It&nbsp;reinforces their self-esteem and helps them to&nbsp;love and accept themselves as&nbsp;they are.</li><li>It&nbsp;allows them to&nbsp;grow happily, transmitting and providing that happiness to&nbsp;their whole environment.</li><li>It&nbsp;strengthens their emotional intelligence and their relationship with their feelings.</li><li>Children who feel loved are positive and optimistic.</li><li>They show politeness and respect for others.</li></ul><p>So, whenever you can, take the opportunity to&nbsp;tell your children how much you love them between hugs and kisses.</p><p><h2>4. “Do&nbsp;you forgive&nbsp;me?”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e9b/e66/4d86455feda04ddbef7c56fda2.jpg><p>As&nbsp;imperfect human beings, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>we&nbsp;all make mistakes</a>, mom and dad included. And what better way to&nbsp;teach our children to&nbsp;accept and take responsibility for their mistakes than by&nbsp;leading by&nbsp;example? When they see that&nbsp;we, their favorite superheroes, put aside our ego and ask for <a href=# title=forgiveness data-link=tag>forgiveness</a>, they will realize how important it&nbsp;really&nbsp;is.</p><p>Many times, we&nbsp;not only do&nbsp;not ask for forgiveness, but we&nbsp;force our children to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it. In&nbsp;these cases, we&nbsp;send children a&nbsp;very confusing message. Instead of&nbsp;fostering <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>empathy</a> for others, by&nbsp;forcing them to&nbsp;do&nbsp;something they don’t want to&nbsp;do, they feel that we&nbsp;are victimizing them, causing them to&nbsp;put their focus on&nbsp;their personal discomfort and not on&nbsp;that of&nbsp;the real victim.</p><p>Therefore, whenever you think you have made a&nbsp;mistake&nbsp;— raising your voice too high, applying an&nbsp;undeserved punishment, or&nbsp;being unfair in&nbsp;any aspect with your children— offer them a&nbsp;sincere apology that is&nbsp;adapted to&nbsp;their age. Explain where you went wrong, how you feel about&nbsp;it, and what you’ve learned from it&nbsp;so&nbsp;your children can understand and apply it&nbsp;as&nbsp;well.</p><p><h2>5. “I&nbsp;believe in&nbsp;you” or&nbsp;“I&nbsp;trust you”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7ec/48a/9a70d25d31865f4beb5f01f70f.jpg><p>When we&nbsp;are little, knowing that mom and dad <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>trust</a> and believe in&nbsp;us makes&nbsp;us feel, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;by&nbsp;magic, all-powerful because they know everything. And even if&nbsp;what we&nbsp;want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;doesn’t work out right the first time, continuing to&nbsp;count on&nbsp;their trust helps&nbsp;us to&nbsp;not get frustrated and to&nbsp;try again.</p><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>lying</a> to&nbsp;children and telling them all the time that we&nbsp;trust them to&nbsp;do&nbsp;whatever it&nbsp;takes, knowing that on&nbsp;certain occasions they won’t really be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it. It&nbsp;may be&nbsp;because the task is&nbsp;not adapted to&nbsp;their age, they aren’t yet ready, or&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;simply impossible (like flying or&nbsp;moving objects with their minds, among other children’s fantasies). Our confidence must be&nbsp;real and justified.</p><p>By&nbsp;trusting them, you will help them develop <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>self-confidence</a>. They will believe that they can (which is&nbsp;the first step in&nbsp;being able&nbsp;to), they won’t give up&nbsp;easily and will look for alternatives and solutions that bring them closer to&nbsp;their goals because they are sure of&nbsp;themselves and trust that they will achieve them.</p><p><h2>6. “I&nbsp;get you” or&nbsp;“I&nbsp;understand how you feel”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/733/d1c/a433695c9cbdca14f0effc8721.jpg><p>This phrase reflects <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>empathy</a> and a&nbsp;connection with our children’s feelings and makes it&nbsp;clear to&nbsp;them that they can count on&nbsp;our understanding and support. For both children and adults, knowing that someone understands&nbsp;us makes&nbsp;us feel supported, identified, and calmer.</p><p>When children feel that they <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>aren’t understood</a>, they become frustrated, and this frustration can lead them to&nbsp;develop very negative feelings that lead to&nbsp;inappropriate or&nbsp;aggressive behavior, unjustified tantrums, uncontrolled crying, and screaming, among other things. This is&nbsp;their way of&nbsp;desperately expressing all the incomprehension they harbor inside.</p><p>A&nbsp;simple and honest “I&nbsp;understand you” at&nbsp;the right time can make all the difference. We&nbsp;can give even more strength to&nbsp;this phrase by&nbsp;sharing an&nbsp;anecdote in&nbsp;which we&nbsp;have lived a&nbsp;similar situation or&nbsp;have felt the same as&nbsp;them. This way they’ll see that not everything is&nbsp;always perfect and that good and bad things happen to&nbsp;everyone, including mom and dad.</p><p><h2>7. “Cry as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;you need&nbsp;to.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/caf/fa7/5f6649521c8a93c3de5e9ee1ac.jpg><p>Crying is&nbsp;a&nbsp;completely natural process that both children and adults experience in&nbsp;certain situations. It&nbsp;isn’t chosen, it&nbsp;just happens, and it&nbsp;isn’t forever. As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;we&nbsp;start to&nbsp;feel relieved, we&nbsp;stop crying. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Asking</a> children to&nbsp;not cry is&nbsp;asking them to&nbsp;repress their emotions, and that way they will never learn to&nbsp;manage them.</p><p>Phrases as&nbsp;common as&nbsp;“be&nbsp;brave,” “men don’t cry,” “it’s all right,” even if&nbsp;they are said with all the good intentions of&nbsp;relieving our little ones’ grief, have a&nbsp;very negative effect. To&nbsp;begin with, the first 2&nbsp;statements are lies: both brave people and men do&nbsp;cry, and that doesn’t make them any less brave or&nbsp;masculine. Also, yes, something does happen, because if&nbsp;nothing happened, the child wouldn’t be&nbsp;crying. To&nbsp;claim that “nothing is&nbsp;going&nbsp;on” when they are feeling the opposite is&nbsp;to&nbsp;downplay their feelings.</p><p>Therefore, the best thing you can do&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;let them vent, listen to&nbsp;them, and offer your support, always seeking to&nbsp;help them understand what they are feeling in&nbsp;a&nbsp;healthy and constructive way. Emotions and feelings&nbsp;— both positive and negative&nbsp;— will definitely be&nbsp;part of&nbsp;their day-to-day life for the rest of&nbsp;their life.</p><p><h2>8. “I’m proud of&nbsp;you.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/07f/521/a204b55c55b4cf1f4a700cb15c.jpg><p>This is&nbsp;another powerful phrase that parents should use often with their children, but with awareness and when the situation warrants&nbsp;it, to&nbsp;praise the moments of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>effort</a> and self-improvement of&nbsp;the child. Don’t focus on&nbsp;the result they obtained, but on&nbsp;the work they did to&nbsp;achieve&nbsp;it, the process they went through, the obstacles they overcame, and the fact that they didn’t give&nbsp;up. Those are the attitudes that should be&nbsp;praised beyond the result they obtained.</p><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;easy and normal to&nbsp;show the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>pride</a> we&nbsp;feel for our children in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;third parties: “My&nbsp;son is&nbsp;already walking,” “My&nbsp;daughter was elected class president,” “My&nbsp;son passed the course with very good grades.” Their achievements&nbsp;— however small or&nbsp;big they may be&nbsp;— make&nbsp;us so&nbsp;happy that we&nbsp;want to&nbsp;share them with the world. But we&nbsp;must not forget that the most important thing is&nbsp;to&nbsp;share them with kids so&nbsp;they know how proud we&nbsp;are.</p><p>As&nbsp;with almost anything, too much of&nbsp;a&nbsp;good thing can also end up&nbsp;being bad, and praise is&nbsp;no&nbsp;different. Praise should always be&nbsp;justified and given at&nbsp;the right times, thus giving your children more self-confidence and positively reinforcing their self-esteem. However, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>too much</a> praise for no&nbsp;real reason can cause your child to&nbsp;become arrogant and behave well only to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;reward.</p><p><h2>9. “Your opinion is&nbsp;important to&nbsp;me.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/92b/200/3cedb05ae3a95cae196019ce69.jpg><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;clear that we&nbsp;always want the best for our children, even if&nbsp;they often don’t understand it&nbsp;or&nbsp;don’t like&nbsp;it. That doesn’t mean that “they must do&nbsp;as&nbsp;we&nbsp;say,” and that we&nbsp;don’t let them have a&nbsp;say or&nbsp;don’t listen to&nbsp;their point of&nbsp;view. Including the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>opinion</a> of&nbsp;our little ones in&nbsp;certain family decisions reinforces their self-esteem and makes them feel happy and an&nbsp;active part of&nbsp;the family.</p><p>Their adult life will be&nbsp;based on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>decision-making</a>, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;important that they begin to&nbsp;develop this ability from an&nbsp;early age. If&nbsp;mom constantly tells&nbsp;us what we&nbsp;should do —without letting&nbsp;us think about it&nbsp;or&nbsp;have a&nbsp;say— the day mom is&nbsp;gone, we&nbsp;won’t know what to&nbsp;do. So&nbsp;whenever you have the opportunity, ask your children for their opinion. For example, ask them about what to&nbsp;do&nbsp;on&nbsp;the weekend, what to&nbsp;give a&nbsp;family member for their birthday, or&nbsp;what movie to&nbsp;see, among other similar situations.</p><p>In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;listening attentively, we&nbsp;can invite them to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>argue</a> their point of&nbsp;view and explain why they think it&nbsp;is&nbsp;the right thing to&nbsp;do. Letting them share their opinions will not only be&nbsp;beneficial for them, but also for their parents since it&nbsp;will give them a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;information about their personality.</p><p><h2>10. “Thank you very much.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5ee/871/2096e954ffbf136f0f7ef8ce52.jpg><p>As&nbsp;the saying goes, “be&nbsp;thankful for small blessings,” and what better way to&nbsp;teach your child to&nbsp;appreciate the actions of&nbsp;others and to&nbsp;be&nbsp;thankful for them than by&nbsp;leading by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>example</a>? We&nbsp;don’t mean the typical polite “thank you.” It&nbsp;goes far beyond good manners and politeness. In&nbsp;other words, what “thank you very much” means&nbsp;is: I&nbsp;know what you’ve done, I&nbsp;want you to&nbsp;know that&nbsp;I appreciate it&nbsp;and that it&nbsp;has made me&nbsp;happy. There are many occasions when we&nbsp;can show gratitude to&nbsp;our children:</p><ul><li><strong>On&nbsp;a&nbsp;daily basis:</strong> we&nbsp;have an&nbsp;infinite number of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>reasons</a> for which to&nbsp;thank our children: any kind of&nbsp;help they give&nbsp;us —like setting the table or&nbsp;taking out the trash— even if&nbsp;that something is&nbsp;their responsibility, like tidying their room.</li><li><strong>For their patience:</strong> many times, even if&nbsp;we&nbsp;don’t notice&nbsp;it, the little ones make really big efforts to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>patient</a> in&nbsp;moments when they are bored, for example, at&nbsp;the supermarket, waiting at&nbsp;the bank, or&nbsp;sitting in&nbsp;a&nbsp;traffic jam that doesn’t move forward. They would rather be&nbsp;playing, but they are there, waiting, and it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;nice gesture on&nbsp;our part to&nbsp;thank them.</li></ul><p>In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;the reasons we&nbsp;have listed above, we&nbsp;know that your child is&nbsp;the apple of&nbsp;your eye, who puts joy and color into your life, who brings a&nbsp;smile to&nbsp;your face even in&nbsp;the worst moments, your main reason for pride and happiness, and all that also deserves a&nbsp;big “thank you.”</p><p>Which of&nbsp;these phrases do&nbsp;you use the most with your children?

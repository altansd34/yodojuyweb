These choices are often so&nbsp;well-made that the viewer creates a&nbsp;powerful relationship with the character. This powerful relationship makes it&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;dissociate the image of&nbsp;the actor and their on-screen role. For instance, can you imagine a&nbsp;Harry Potter played by&nbsp;someone other than <a href=# title="Daniel Radcliffe" data-link=tag>Daniel Radcliffe</a>, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;Hermione not played by&nbsp;<a href=# title="Emma Watson" data-link=tag>Emma Watson</a>? Well, even though many of&nbsp;us think that these actors were “born” to&nbsp;play these roles, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;possible that on&nbsp;several occasions the producers did not agree at&nbsp;first and they may have even chosen someone else. It’s hard to&nbsp;believe, but true.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we’re all Potterheads. That’s why we’d love to&nbsp;share with you all the fun facts about the “wizarding world” that we&nbsp;found out there. We’d also like to&nbsp;extend an&nbsp;invitation to&nbsp;a&nbsp;parallel universe where other actors that were about to&nbsp;play some of&nbsp;the most famous wizards in&nbsp;the world actually <i>did</i> get the roles. Don’t forget to&nbsp;check out the <strong>bonus</strong> at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the article!</p><p><h2>1. Ian McKellen&nbsp;— Albus Dumbledore</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/16c/3c1/25e50a55edadab681c24f9da72.jpg><p>Sir Ian McKellen, known for the amazing performances he&nbsp;delivered in&nbsp;<a href=# title=movies data-link=tag>movies</a> like <i>The Lord of&nbsp;the Rings</i> and <i>The Da&nbsp;Vinci Code</i>, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;in&nbsp;many theater plays, was asked to&nbsp;bring the famous wizard Albus Dumbledore to&nbsp;the big screen after actor Richard Harris, the then-Dumbledore interpreter, sadly passed away. This happened back in&nbsp;2002, but McKellen had to&nbsp;face a&nbsp;tough <a href=#>dilemma</a> after which he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;turn down the opportunity.</p><p>It&nbsp;all started when, back in&nbsp;the day, Richard Harris said that even though he&nbsp;found McKellan to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;brilliant actor in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;technique, he&nbsp;lacked passion when acting. McKellan had to&nbsp;decide whether he’d take on&nbsp;the legacy of&nbsp;a&nbsp;man who disapproved of&nbsp;him as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor. We&nbsp;all know how the story ended. McKellen refused, saying that he&nbsp;“couldn’t take on&nbsp;the role of&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor who didn’t approve of&nbsp;me.” While we&nbsp;all think he&nbsp;would have played an&nbsp;amazing role as&nbsp;Dumbledore, it&nbsp;was <a href=#>Michael Gambon</a> who eventually landed the role.</p><p><h2>2. Saoirse Ronan&nbsp;— Luna Lovegood</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3ad/cd7/19ee925ea69bb083a5986e404a.jpg><p>Actress Saoirse Ronan became popular after she appeared in&nbsp;films like <i>The Lovely Bones</i> and <i>Little Women</i>. But few people know that she actually auditioned to&nbsp;play the role of&nbsp;Luna Lovegood in&nbsp;the <i>Harry Potter</i> saga. Unfortunately, she did not get the role, which Evanna Lynch ended up&nbsp;landing because she was specifically <a href=#>chosen</a> by&nbsp;the creator of&nbsp;the story, J.K. Rowling. According to&nbsp;her, Lynch was the perfect person to&nbsp;play this character.</p><p>Saoirse, however, admitted that she was disappointed when she learned that she was not chosen. During an&nbsp;interview Ronan <a href=#>said</a> that she “was too young&nbsp;— but at&nbsp;the time I&nbsp;thought, ’I’d love to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;Harry Potter.’ When I&nbsp;was younger, I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;think they had the best job in&nbsp;the world.” Today, with more than 3&nbsp;Oscar <a href=#>nominations</a> in&nbsp;her pocket, we&nbsp;wonder what a&nbsp;Luna played by&nbsp;Saoirse would look like and what vibe she would have given to&nbsp;the whole franchise.</p><p><h2>3. Liam Aiken&nbsp;— Harry Potter</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d5e/638/24c9e45b48ba8227c0ff9da5b9.jpg><p>Originally, Liam Aiken, the star of&nbsp;the saga <i>A&nbsp;Series of&nbsp;Unfortunate Events,</i> was supposed to&nbsp;have <a href=#>starred</a> in&nbsp;the role of&nbsp;Harry Potter on&nbsp;the big screen. However, J.K. Rowling had her say once again, and that changed everything. The writer demanded that the whole cast of&nbsp;the movie be&nbsp;composed of&nbsp;only British actors. This instantly ruled out Aiken and that opened the door for British actor Daniel Radcliff to&nbsp;land the role that defined his career when he&nbsp;was barely <a href=#>11&nbsp;years old</a>.</p><p>According to&nbsp;the British newspaper <a href=#><i>The Guardian</i></a>, J.K. Rowling even took the time to&nbsp;call producer Chris Columbus, who was in&nbsp;charge of&nbsp;adapting her books to&nbsp;the movies just to&nbsp;make sure that Aiken didn’t get the part. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;believed that the reasoning behind Rowling’s decision was to&nbsp;ensure that the films remained faithful to&nbsp;the books, which were supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;British in&nbsp;every sense of&nbsp;the word. It’s unclear as&nbsp;to&nbsp;whether Aiken would have delivered a&nbsp;better performance than Radcliff, who in&nbsp;any case did a&nbsp;great job.</p><p><h2>4. Robin Williams&nbsp;— Rubeus Hagrid</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fcf/7b9/60ef3854a7bc355c706bd7eff1.jpg><p>Once again, J.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;Rowling was very adamant when it&nbsp;came to&nbsp;not allowing the movie about the most famous wizard to&nbsp;be&nbsp;cast using American actors... Being British herself, she put enormous pressure on&nbsp;the production team to&nbsp;get what she wanted. In&nbsp;the end, she got it&nbsp;her way: the cast ended up&nbsp;being entirely British, which indeed, gave a&nbsp;special feeling to&nbsp;the movies. So, in&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;Liam Aiken, <a href=# title="Robin Williams" data-link=tag>Robin Williams</a>, who was cast to&nbsp;play the iconic Rubeus Hagrid, was also <a href=#>vetoed</a> from the saga. This beloved character was, in&nbsp;the end, portrayed with great mastery by&nbsp;Robbie Coltrane. We&nbsp;are sure that, like Coltrane, Williams would have done a&nbsp;great job!</p><p><h2>5. Helen McCrory&nbsp;— Bellatrix Lestrange</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/00b/df3/7fc95653c3ac4e2d5da0cfc722.jpg><p>The great and scary witch, Bellatrix Lestrange, was originally going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;played by&nbsp;Helen McCrory. With McCrory being English, there was no&nbsp;possible veto coming from J.K. Rowling. However, at&nbsp;the time in&nbsp;which the Harry Potter movies were to&nbsp;be&nbsp;shot, the star from Netflix’s drama series <i>Peaky Blinders</i> became pregnant. There’s probably no&nbsp;better reason to&nbsp;<a href=#>give up</a>&nbsp;playing such an&nbsp;amazing character. Eventually, it&nbsp;was <a href=# title="Helena Bonham Carter" data-link=tag>Helena Bonham Carter</a> who replaced McCrory and she delivered one of&nbsp;the best performances of&nbsp;the saga. Still, McCrory hadn’t said her final words on&nbsp;the matter. Luckily for&nbsp;us, she managed to&nbsp;come back to&nbsp;the casting in&nbsp;the last 3&nbsp;movies, but this time as&nbsp;Narcissa Malfoy.</p><p><h2>6. Henry Cavill&nbsp;— Cedric Diggory</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/96f/e3d/10d608569cbdba24a559c15097.jpg><p>Before Cavill even dreamt of&nbsp;becoming the famous Superman who won the hearts of&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;viewers around the world, things weren’t looking so&nbsp;bright for him. In&nbsp;fact, Cavill managed to&nbsp;lose not one, but 2&nbsp;roles to&nbsp;<a href=# title="Robert Pattinson" data-link=tag>Robert Pattinson</a>. The first one is&nbsp;maybe lesser known by&nbsp;the public. He&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;get into <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of&nbsp;Fire</i>, where he&nbsp;auditioned to&nbsp;play Cedric Diggory. The second role he&nbsp;lost to&nbsp;Pattinson is&nbsp;a&nbsp;well-known story. Cavill came <a href=#>close</a> to&nbsp;playing the role of&nbsp;Edward Cullen, the protagonist in&nbsp;the <i>Twilight</i> saga.</p><p>In&nbsp;fact, in&nbsp;the latter, he&nbsp;even turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the <a href=#>first choice</a> of&nbsp;writer Stephenie Meyer, creator of&nbsp;the “Cullen universe.” However, as&nbsp;you probably know, both roles, in&nbsp;the end, went to&nbsp;Pattinson. Cavill simply <a href=#>thought</a> of&nbsp;the rejections as&nbsp;“something good” that happened in&nbsp;his life. After all, things happen in&nbsp;due time and there’s no&nbsp;reason to&nbsp;rush anything.</p><p><h2>7. Hatty Jones&nbsp;— Hermione Granger</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d1f/211/1995f45d95a4be1ad2ba78c800.jpg><p>As&nbsp;for the role of&nbsp;Hermione Granger, producers had a&nbsp;hard time <a href=#>deciding</a> between 2&nbsp;young actresses that were equally fit to&nbsp;play the smarter sorceress of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hogwarts data-link=tag>Hogwarts</a>: Hatty Jones, star of&nbsp;the feature film <i>Madeline</i>, and Emma Watson, who until then was an&nbsp;unknown actress. Interestingly enough, the decision was made based on&nbsp;casting director Janet Hirshenson’s impressions of&nbsp;Emma. Hirshernson believed the young woman would bring a&nbsp;much-needed “dull” side to&nbsp;the whole story. In&nbsp;the end, it&nbsp;seems like she did the right thing, given that Watson managed to&nbsp;steal the audience’s hearts and souls thanks to&nbsp;her skills and empathic nature.</p><p>“A&nbsp;star is&nbsp;born,” Hirshenson <a href=#>said</a> during an&nbsp;interview. Hirshenson’s decision was so&nbsp;accurate that today it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;impossible to&nbsp;imagine any other actress playing Hermione.</p><p><h2>8. Jamie Campbell Bower&nbsp;— Tom Riddle (Lord Voldemort when he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;young man)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2db/ff7/9fe4c45c9a95d5102359917f99.jpg><p>Actor Jamie Campbell Bower is&nbsp;most likely a&nbsp;big fan of&nbsp;the wizard sagas. This beloved star had not only been part of&nbsp;the cast of&nbsp;<i>Twilight</i>, but he&nbsp;also appeared in&nbsp;<i>The Mortal Instruments: City of&nbsp;Bones.</i> Of&nbsp;course, little did he&nbsp;know back then that he&nbsp;would also appear in&nbsp;other movies based on&nbsp;J.K. Rowling’s work <i>Fantastic Beasts and Where to&nbsp;Find Them</i>, a&nbsp;franchise that acts as&nbsp;a&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;spin-off for the Harry Potter world. He&nbsp;played <a href=#>Grindelwald</a> in&nbsp;both <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&nbsp;— Part 1</i>&nbsp;and <i>Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of&nbsp;Grindelwald.</i></p><p>And we’re saying that because we&nbsp;want to&nbsp;clarify something that many people still don’t know: before landing that role, Jamie Campbell Bower had auditioned to&nbsp;<a href=#>play</a> the young version of&nbsp;Tom Riddle (Lord Voldemort) in&nbsp;the sixth film of&nbsp;the <i>Harry Potter</i> saga. Not only that, but he&nbsp;was even <a href=#>featured</a> in&nbsp;<i>Teen</i> <i>Vogue </i>magazine. In&nbsp;the end, he&nbsp;was not chosen to&nbsp;play the part, but the reasons behind his rejection remain unclear. The role was, as&nbsp;you know, left in&nbsp;the hands of&nbsp;Frank Dillane.</p><p><h2>9. Eddie Redmayne&nbsp;— Another version of&nbsp;Tom Riddle (Lord Voldemort when he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;teenager)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a60/3ed/a345b150d586dd0e72d8d48d23.jpg><p>Jamie Campbell Bower wasn’t the only actor who was interested in&nbsp;playing the young version of&nbsp;Harry Potter’s nemesis, Lord Voldemort, also known as&nbsp;Tom Riddle. Much like Campbell Bower, Eddie Redmayne didn’t manage to&nbsp;land the <a href=#>role</a> of&nbsp;the larger-than-life villain, but his patience was also rewarded when he&nbsp;was cast in&nbsp;the <i>Fantastic Beasts and Where to&nbsp;Find Them</i> franchise, this time as&nbsp;the main character, Newt Scamander.</p><p>During an&nbsp;interview, Eddie <a href=#>revealed</a> that even though he&nbsp;didn’t even receive any feedback after the audition, over the years he&nbsp;still had a&nbsp;ray of&nbsp;hope shining somewhere inside his soul that he&nbsp;would at&nbsp;least be&nbsp;cast as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the Weasley family members. Of&nbsp;course, as&nbsp;we&nbsp;all well know, this didn’t happen. But fortunately, this brilliant actor did manage to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;play his part in&nbsp;a&nbsp;universe created by&nbsp;J.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;Rowling and he&nbsp;did a&nbsp;great job. In&nbsp;the end, it&nbsp;was Christian Coulson who played Tom Riddle in&nbsp;<i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of&nbsp;Secrets</i>.</p><p><h2>10. Tilda Swinton&nbsp;— Sybill Trelawney</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b72/3cd/e58a4259179c4ecdcc8ccda777.jpg><p>Oscar winner Emma Thompson <a href=#>took</a> on&nbsp;the role of&nbsp;Professor Sybill Trelawney. However, before the deal was closed between the producers and Thompson, the character was first offered to&nbsp;fellow Golden Statuette winner Tilda Swinton, who <a href=#>turned it&nbsp;down</a>. While her decision might come across as&nbsp;something strange when looking back, as&nbsp;Swinton explained in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, according to&nbsp;her the saga romanticized boarding school life and she didn’t really want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;that:</p><p>“I&nbsp;think this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very cruel environment that children have to&nbsp;grow up&nbsp;in, and&nbsp;I don’t think it’s beneficial to&nbsp;their education.” We’re not entirely sure if&nbsp;Swinton was right or&nbsp;not to&nbsp;reject the role, but one thing we&nbsp;can all agree with is&nbsp;that Emma Thompson was as&nbsp;perfect for the role as&nbsp;Swinton would have been, would she have decided to&nbsp;jump on&nbsp;board.</p><p><h2>11. Jason Isaacs&nbsp;— Gilderoy Lockhart</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/058/8be/c7e4695a5787462e72e51baf1f.jpg><p>Jason Isaacs, known today for having played Lucius Malfoy, initially wanted to&nbsp;play a&nbsp;completely different role: half-blood wizard Gilderoy Lockhart. However, the producers felt that Isaacs would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;much better fit for Draco Malfoy’s father and also one of&nbsp;the greatest adversaries that Potter has had to&nbsp;deal with during the whole saga. The funny thing is&nbsp;that, at&nbsp;the same time, the actor was already slated to&nbsp;play Captain Hook in&nbsp;<i>Peter Pan</i>, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;linked to&nbsp;the image of&nbsp;2&nbsp;childish villains. This is&nbsp;the reasoning that led him to&nbsp;turn down the role in&nbsp;the first place.</p><p>Luckily for&nbsp;us and all Potterheads, Isaacs’ family stepped in&nbsp;and convinced him to&nbsp;play the wizard known for having long, smooth blond hair. “Over the weekend, everyone who knew me&nbsp;called&nbsp;me: nieces, nephews, godchildren, and then their parents,” he&nbsp;<a href=#>said</a>. “They all tried to&nbsp;persuade me&nbsp;to&nbsp;take the job, not because they cared about&nbsp;me, but because they wanted to&nbsp;visit the set!” he&nbsp;added laughingly.</p><p><h2>12. Kate Winslet&nbsp;— Helena Ravenclaw</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e4a/14c/a704d855579994ea335fb7fbbe.jpg><p>When one of&nbsp;the most popular sagas of&nbsp;the time was coming to&nbsp;an&nbsp;end, producers thought they had to&nbsp;come up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;great way to&nbsp;say goodbye. They wanted every detail to&nbsp;be&nbsp;perfect and that included finding an&nbsp;<a href=#>actress</a> who could live up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the greatness of&nbsp;Helena Ravenclaw, a&nbsp;character whose part in&nbsp;the narrative was kind of&nbsp;short, but of&nbsp;the utmost importance. The name at&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;the list was Kate Winslet. Unfortunately, her agent <a href=#>rejected</a> the script even before checking to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;she was interested at&nbsp;all in&nbsp;taking part in&nbsp;the project. That’s how the Grey Lady ended up&nbsp;being played by&nbsp;the equally brilliant Kelly Macdonald.</p><p><h2>13. Thomas Brodie-Sangster&nbsp;— Ron Weasley</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/57a/473/fceb675f75ab346e694eef8611.jpg><p>Thomas Brodie-Sangster revealed that he&nbsp;would have loved to&nbsp;<a href=#>play</a> Ron Weasley on&nbsp;the big screen. Not only that, but he&nbsp;actually gave it&nbsp;a&nbsp;try and ended up&nbsp;losing the opportunity to&nbsp;Rupert Grint, the little redhead that is&nbsp;now very well-known to&nbsp;all of&nbsp;the fans of&nbsp;the saga. However, despite not having passed the test, the actor from <i>Nanny McPhee</i>, also <a href=#>said</a> that this first “tough” experience of&nbsp;rejection in&nbsp;the entertainment industry “allowed him to&nbsp;maintain a&nbsp;more ’optimistic’ attitude during the audition processes for future roles.” As&nbsp;the popular saying goes, “Every cloud has a&nbsp;silver lining.”</p><p><h2>14. Tom Felton&nbsp;— Ron Weasley and Harry Potter</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/038/7f7/07f5da530894c6070965ec5b43.jpg><p>You might find this hard to&nbsp;believe, but it’s true. Before becoming the naughty Draco Malfoy, Tom Felton auditioned to&nbsp;play Ron Weasley and even Harry Potter. Despite not being chosen for either role, the actor claims there was never any jealousy or&nbsp;rivalry behind the scenes between him and Radcliffe or&nbsp;Grint. On&nbsp;the contrary, he&nbsp;was very grateful to&nbsp;have the opportunity to&nbsp;appear in&nbsp;the movies at&nbsp;all. “I’m even more grateful that&nbsp;I got the character of&nbsp;Draco, there was a&nbsp;great sense of&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;being on&nbsp;a&nbsp;team,” he&nbsp;<a href=#>said</a>. And it&nbsp;seems that the choices were indeed perfect, like Felton mentioned, as&nbsp;that’s how each of&nbsp;the actors becomes a&nbsp;living legend in&nbsp;their own role.</p><p><h2>Bonus: The creator of&nbsp;the <i>Harry Potter</i> universe, writer J.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;Rowling, was asked by&nbsp;producers to&nbsp;play Lily, the mother of&nbsp;The Boy Who Lived.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/211/213/56c1ab529bb01c21f12cecb380.jpg><p>There’s no&nbsp;point in&nbsp;denying that there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;great similarity between J.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;Rowling and Geraldine Somerville. Maybe that is&nbsp;why the producers of&nbsp;the saga wanted the writer to&nbsp;take on&nbsp;the role of&nbsp;Lily Potter in&nbsp;<i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</i>, since she fit “the profile” so&nbsp;well. However, Rowling politely declined the <a href=#>invitation</a>: “The filmmakers did ask me&nbsp;to&nbsp;play Lily Potter in&nbsp;the first film, but&nbsp;I really am&nbsp;not cut out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress, even one who just has to&nbsp;stand there and wave. I&nbsp;would have messed it&nbsp;up&nbsp;somehow.” It’s hard to&nbsp;believe that maybe we&nbsp;could have had the chance to&nbsp;see J.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;Rowling on&nbsp;the big screen, but it’s true. And we&nbsp;actually think that she would have done a&nbsp;great job!</p><p>Most people think that producers made the right call with the cast they chose for the Potter movies. Do&nbsp;you agree or&nbsp;is&nbsp;there someone who you think would have done a&nbsp;better job?

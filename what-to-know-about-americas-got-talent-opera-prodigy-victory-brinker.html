The tiny star auditioned for <a href=#>America’s Got Talent</a> this season. Many believe she is the recipient of the show’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">first-ever team Golden Buzzer.</a> Victory’s life is about to change forever after stepping onto the biggest stage in the world.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-victory-brinker-already-has-an-impressive-resume-ahead-of-america-s-got-talent-audition>Victory Brinker Already Has An Impressive Resume Ahead of ‘America’s Got Talent’ Audition</h2><p>Victory has been singing since she was two years old and began to pursue classical music when she was 6. She watched YouTube videos early on that influenced her to want to pursue a career as an opera singer. The ability to hit super high notes is what really drew her in. Her love for music has taken her all over the United States to perform for huge audiences. This on-stage experience will come in handy for her performance on America’s Got Talent.</p><p>In 2018, Victory won first place in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>her very first talent show</a> singing “Ave Maria.” Victory went from performing on local talent show stages to performing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>at Carnegie Hall.</a> You might even remember her from her viral<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link> “too tired” Vine</a> when she was just two years old. Her star quality was already apparent from a young age.</p><p>Victory <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>opened for Gianni Russo</a> at The Butler Italian Festival.&nbsp;It’s not every day that an America’s Got Talent contestant has rubbed elbows with Carlo Rizzi from The Godfather. Victory performed five songs in Italian at the show. She also landed her first movie role as a featured extra in The Boy Hero in 2018 along with the lead role in the Christian film Helping Izzy. She has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>sung the National Anthem</a> at several sports games and performed at the Apollo.</p><p>With the love and support of her parents and 10 siblings, Victory went to perform on Little Big Shots in front of Melissa McCarthy last year. Victory can perform in seven languages. This year she sang “Just Sing” for the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>DreamWorks Trolls World Tour</a> video in German. She also performed a beautiful cover of “Fall On Me” by Andrea&nbsp;Bocelli on YouTube. This song perfectly showcases her angelic voice.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-victory-headed-for-victory>Is Victory Headed for Victory?</h2><p>This year on America’s Got Talent, the judges are doing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">something they have never done</a> in the show’s history. All four judges and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Terry Crews</a> will be hitting the Golden Buzzer together. Several fans on Instagram believe that Victory is the recipient of this special Golden Buzzer. All of the judges already gave out <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">their individual Golden Buzzers</a> and it takes someone very special to change the course of the show.</p><p>In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the first promo</a> for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 16,</a> singer Matt Mauser <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">speaks about losing his wife</a> in the helicopter crash that killed Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna. Initially, we thought Matt was a shoo-in for this Golden Buzzer due to his determination to show his children how to keep their heads up. It appears that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sofia Vergara</a> is wearing a red dress during Matt’s audition. In the scene where all of the judges and Crews hit the Golden Buzzer, Vergara is wearing a blue dress.</p><p>Looking at the lineup for Tuesday’s jam-packed episode, Victory and Matt are certainly the two standout contestants. Based on the history of the competition, child opera singers usually do rather well. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jackie Evancho</a> was able to build her career off of America’s Got Talent and eventually land a spot on The Masked Singer. Victory has the chance to achieve this same level of fame.</p><p>Do you think Victory will get the five-way Golden Buzzer during Tuesday’s episode of America’s Got Talent? The only way to find out is to tune in to NBC at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Kayden-Stephenson-Michael-Becker-Fox.jpeg alt="Kayden Stephenson Hopes to Find Success with Debut Single ‘Rodéo’ After ‘American Idol’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGYrWWkpHqsus6wZJqan6rBbq3Mnqmim5Goeqi702armqSVo8Fuu8%2BeqZploKe8pbXGsmSvoZOpvLPFjJupoqabmr9w</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-victoria-beckham-never-smiles-in-pictures-818622.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Victoria Beckham Never Smiles in Pictures</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1606125-what-tinubu-waited-happen-implementing-n70000-gov-diri-explains.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Tinubu Should Have Waited To Happen Before Implementing N70,000 Minimum Wage, Gov Diri Speaks</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

The video titled “It Was All A Dream Come True” teases clips of some of the incredible auditions to look forward to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">when the show premieres on June 1.</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meet-some-of-the-america-s-got-talent-contestants-featured-in-new-video>Meet Some of the ‘America’s Got Talent’ Contestants Featured in New Video</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-belle-marie>Belle Marie</h2><p>Belle Marie is a tiny dancer ready to take America’s Got Talent by storm. The kindergarten student from Miami has competed in so many dance competitions that she is basically a pro already. At just 6 years old, she will definitely be one of the youngest solo acts in the competition.</p><p>Her abilities go far beyond the lyrical dancing we have seen on America’s Got Talent in the past, with ballet and gymnastics training in her back pocket to use to impress the judges. Belle will have an adorable on-stage moment hugging her mom during her audition. Do not be surprised if we see this pint-sized powerhouse move on to the Judge Cuts.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-positive-impact-movement>Positive Impact Movement</h2><p>One Season 16 America’s Got Talent act is going to have all of the ladies swooning. You know how <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Heidi Klum</a> gets when shirtless men with abs step onto the stage. Positive Impact Movement is a team of four acrobats who are, simply put, totally hot. Group members Andreas Alfaro and Travis Brewer previously competed on American Ninja Warrior. Group members Nathan Tsuji and James have performed with Cirque Du Soleil.</p><p>Their audition will be filled with bold stunts that will most likely have the judges biting their nails. In the trailer for Season 16, two group members are seen jumping onto the other group members’ shoulders. They will also incorporate barbells into their routine. Positive Impact Movement is the only act to be featured in the trailer twice, a good sign that they will make it into the Judge Cuts.<br></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-buddy-the-rat>Buddy the Rat</h2><p>Buddy the Rat is headed to America’s Got Talent! In the Season 16 trailer, Jonothon Lyons, dressed in his signature Buddy The Rat costume plays the piano. He has become <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>known to many New Yorkers as an icon</a>, posting videos of himself roaming around the city on all-fours. The performance artist is a master of theater and puppetry&nbsp;that led him to come up with this persona over a decade ago.</p><p>During the pandemic, Buddy the Rat has kept us all entertained with his TikToks which have earned him over 1.2 million followers on the platform. He recreated the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">viral pizza rat video</a>&nbsp;that one New Yorker previously filmed in 2015. This time Jonothon nibbled on an oversized fake piece of pizza. His America’s Got Talent audition is going to be anything but predictable.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ray-singleton>Ray Singleton</h2><p>Ray Singleton posted a video singing Daniel Caesar’s “Get You” and shared photos showing his wife Ros’s cancer battle that went viral in 2020. Ros is an 8-year Navy veteran and two-time cancer survivor. The couple made an appearance on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a> to talk about Ros’s cancer journey. They even received a special message from Gabrielle Union’s husband <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Dwayne Wade</a> who was once a guest judge on America’s Got Talent.</p><p>Ray and Ros will share an emotional moment on the America’s Got Talent stage during his audition. We see them both ready to burst into tears in the trailer. It appears by sifting through Ros’s Instagram that Ray will be playing the keyboard for his big performance. If his audition is anything like the singing videos he uploads online, expect to see Ray either earn a Golden Buzzer or make it through to the Judge Cuts.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-aidan>Aidan</h2><p>While we do not know a ton of information about Aidan just yet, we do know that his mother Pam Cutrona Bennett is very proud of him. She posted two photos of Aidan at his audition preparing for his time on stage.</p><p>In the trailer for Season 16, Aidan is seen suspended in the air. He is spinning super fast while balancing on a hoop. We suspect he is an aerial artist and his flexibility points to him having some acrobatic skills that will give the other contestants a run for their money.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHICH PAST ‘AGT’ STARS WILL BE FEATURED ON THIS YEAR’S SHOW?</a></strong></p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ezat-azur-x-factor-uk.jpg alt="Watch Simon Cowell React to Cringey Version of ‘Bang Bang’ on ‘X Factor UK’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWknbJur86nq56rpJa7tb%2BMrJyepl2eu27Ax55kn6GiqMFurcyeqaKbkah6qLvTZquapJWjwW5%2Bj2toZqyilratsdFo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1570978-epic-moment-uche-jombos-son-jealous-mom-hug-movie-daughter-screen.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Moment Uche Jombos Son Said He Is Jealous of Seeing His Mom Hug Her Movie Daughter on Screen</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./prenoms-anglais.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Les prnoms anglais les plus populaires</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

Many people who speak Spanish say they can at least understand Portuguese, and vice versa. But how similar are they really? Let’s dive into the differences and similarities between the two languages.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Similarities-between-Spanish-and-Portuguese>Similarities between Spanish and Portuguese</h2><p>As languages that evolved from Latin, Spanish and Portuguese are both considered <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Romance languages</a>. Due to their shared parent language, much of their vocabulary, syntax and conjugation sounds similar to both native speakers and language learners.</p><p>Both Spanish and Portuguese share the same alphabet, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">word order</a> and usage of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">gender with nouns</a>. They are also both spoken on the Iberian Peninsula, where present-day Spain and Portugal are located.</p><p>Both languages have also made their way around the world, though Spanish has proven more successful in that regard. There are about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">500 million</a> Spanish speakers in the world compared to about 260 million Portuguese speakers. This is related to the fact that Spanish is the official language of 20 countries, while Portuguese is the official language of only 10 countries.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Differences-between-Spanish-and-Portuguese>Differences between Spanish and Portuguese</h2><ul><li><strong>Pronunciation. </strong>There are some differences in pronunciation between Spanish and Portuguese. In Spanish, the “b,” “d” and “g” sounds are pronounced more softly than in Portuguese.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Linguistics. </strong>In general, Portuguese has more fricative (hushing and hissing) sounds than Spanish. For example, the Spanish word for “to arrive” is llegar, which in Portuguese translates to chegar.</li><li><strong>Vowel sounds. </strong>Portuguese has 14 vowel sounds, while Spanish only has 5 vowel sounds. All vowels in Spanish are clearly pronounced, but that’s not the case with Portuguese. Portuguese also has certain vowels that are pronounced with a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">nasal tone</a>, such as the ã in the city São Paulo. This nasal pronunciation does not exist in Spanish.</li></ul><p>Due to these differences, how hard is it for Spanish speakers to say Portuguese words correctly? Watch this YouTube video to hear examples of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pronunciation success and failure</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=False-cognates-in-Spanish-vs.-Portuguese>False cognates in Spanish vs. Portuguese</h2><p>Portuguese and Spanish share almost 90% of their vocabulary. However, while the majority of the words are quite similar and carry similar meanings,&nbsp; you’ll still come across a number of false cognates.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody readability=5><tr><td><strong>Cognate</strong></td><td><strong>Spanish meaning</strong></td><td><strong>Portuguese meaning</strong></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>pelado</td><td>shaved head or a new haircut</td><td>to be naked</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>largo</td><td>long&nbsp;(ancho means wide)</td><td>wide&nbsp;( longo means long)</td></tr><tr><td>polvo</td><td>dust</td><td>octopus</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>exquisita (ES) and esquisita (PT)</td><td>delicious&nbsp;</td><td>weird&nbsp;(the “x” changes to “s”)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>rojo (ES) vs roxo (PT)</td><td>red</td><td>purple (vermelho means red)&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Check out this TikTok video for more <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">examples of false cognates</a> between Portuguese and Spanish.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Grammatical-similarities-between-Portuguese-and-Spanish>Grammatical similarities between Portuguese and Spanish</h2><p>Let’s look at a few specific instances where Portuguese and Spanish grammar are similar.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Pronouns</h3><p>The pronouns in Portuguese and Spanish are very similar.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody><tr><td><strong>English pronoun</strong></td><td><strong>Portuguese pronoun</strong></td><td><strong>Spanish pronoun</strong></td></tr><tr><td>I</td><td>eu</td><td>yo</td></tr><tr><td>you</td><td>tu / você (formal)</td><td>tú / usted (formal)</td></tr><tr><td>she/he</td><td>ela / ele</td><td>ella / él</td></tr><tr><td>we</td><td>nós</td><td>nosotros</td></tr><tr><td>you</td><td>vós (vocês)</td><td>vosotros</td></tr><tr><td>they</td><td>elas / eles</td><td>ellas / ellos</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Articles</h3><p>Both Spanish and Portuguese have definite articles that must agree in number and gender with the nouns they modify.

Spanish has more native and non-native speakers than Portuguese, which you might want to keep in mind when making a decision. This can be an important factor when looking for classes or people to practice with.</p><p>(<strong>Note</strong>: Just like the Spanish spoken in Spain is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">different</a> from the Spanish spoken in Latin America, the same is true for Portuguese in Portugal and Brazil.)</p><p>If you’re the indecisive type, the good news is that, if you speak one language, you may be able to understand some things from the other language. Thinking about learning Spanish or Portuguese? <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">An intro class</a> is a great way to help you decide which language to focus on.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/alison-2-3.jpg><h2>Alison Maciejewski Cortez</h2><p>Alison Maciejewski Cortez is Chilean-American, born and raised in California.

Those aged 25-49 are also more in favour than not, by 46% to 33%, but this is flipped among 50-64 year olds who find such a depiction unacceptable by 47% to 31%. Most Britons aged 65 and over cannot tolerate a homosexual Father Christmas, by 58% to 24%.</p><p>Gender also plays a role, with men saying gay Santa is unacceptable by 46% to 36%, while women accept such depictions by 42% to 36%.</p><h3>Can Santa be female?</h3><p>The public are firmly against a female Father Christmas, with Britons saying such depictions would be unacceptable by two to one (54% to 27%). Women are just as likely as men (56% and 53%) to say no to a Saint Nicola.</p><p>There is, however, plurality support among 18-24 year olds for allowing women to step into Santa’s shoes, with 45% saying it would be acceptable to 31% who say it would be unacceptable.</p><h3>Can Santa be Black, Middle Eastern or Asian?</h3><p>A YouGov study in the USA last year examined <a href=#>attitudes towards Santa (and Jesus) being depicted as various races</a>.</p><p>Here in the UK, people are less accepting of a non-White Father Christmas. While eight in ten (80%) say it is acceptable to depict Santa as being White (virtually identical to the number of Americans who said so), only about half of Britons (49-53%) say it’s ok for him to be shown as being from any of the other ethnicities we asked about (Black, Middle-Eastern, East Asian or South Asian). By contrast, in the USA two thirds (67%) were accepting of a Black Santa, and 58-60% were comfortable with an Asian or Middle-Eastern Kris Kringle.</p><p>Again, age plays a role. Younger Britons are more accepting of non-White Saint Nicks, but are also slightly less likely to see a White Santa as ok at 71% compared to 79-82% of other age groups (although this is because they are more likely to say don’t know than other age groups, rather than specifically being opposed to the traditional depiction of Father Christmas).</p><p>Attitudes among Britons from ethnic minority backgrounds are largely the same to the wider population. The biggest difference is over depicting Father Christmas as White, which 68% say is acceptable, 12pts lower than the public as a whole. Nevertheless, only 11% consider a White Santa Claus to be unacceptable.</p><p>Results among ethnic minority Britons who are Christian are effectively the same as those of ethnic minority Britons in general. The only difference is that a Black Father Christmas is slightly more acceptable among the former group (55%) than the latter (49%).</p><h3>Attitudes towards changing Santa’s characteristics are not unique</h3><p>Back in 2018, <a href=#>YouGov asked about the demographics of another famous fictional straight White man: James Bond</a>. Attitudes towards the race, gender and sexuality of Father Christmas largely echo those from the James Bond survey, with generally favourable attitudes to changing 007’s race, relative division on his sexual preferences (Britons tended to oppose a gay Bond by 47% to 40%) and firm opposition to a female James.</p><p>This suggests that opinion towards Father Christmas is not unique to the character himself, and may instead reflect a broader set of attitudes on making changes to firmly established pop culture figures.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Santa20v20James20Bond-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhsYGZ%2Bd3nCmqVmq5GjwaJ5wZ5koJmp</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./celebrity-mastermind.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Celebrity Mastermind popularity &amp;amp; fame</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bonfire-night.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bonfire Night: Top 10 Vocab Tips | Lingoda</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

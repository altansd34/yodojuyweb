It’s common to&nbsp;feel like an&nbsp;outsider despite trying to&nbsp;bond and connect with everyone. This feeling of&nbsp;being on&nbsp;the outside can be&nbsp;quite hurtful and difficult to&nbsp;handle. A&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Reddit user</a> shared a&nbsp;similar situation.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;woman had a&nbsp;conflict with her mother-in-law.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0a2/fff/487ec855be90e99bbb35037c18.jpg><p>My&nbsp;boyfriend Nick and&nbsp;I have been dating for 3&nbsp;years, almost 4&nbsp;now. Before this incident, I&nbsp;got along great with his family. I&nbsp;was invited to&nbsp;spend holidays with them, and we&nbsp;exchanged gifts on&nbsp;birthdays, so&nbsp;I thought we&nbsp;were pretty close.</p><p>Every year, Nick’s family goes on&nbsp;a&nbsp;trip; this summer, the trip was to&nbsp;somewhere&nbsp;I really wanted to&nbsp;go. I&nbsp;asked his mom, who was planning the trip if&nbsp;I could tag along if&nbsp;I paid for myself. She said sorry, no, but this was a&nbsp;family trip, and&nbsp;I wasn’t family yet. I&nbsp;told Nick, and he&nbsp;said no&nbsp;one’s s/o was invited, so&nbsp;I wasn’t the only one being excluded. I&nbsp;was still upset but dropped the subject.</p><p>It’s now fall, and the weather is&nbsp;getting cooler. Nick’s family was coming over, so&nbsp;I made my&nbsp;family’s chili recipe to&nbsp;celebrate the cold weather. Nick and his family love my&nbsp;chili, so&nbsp;I ensured they had enough to&nbsp;take home. Before Nick’s mom left, she asked if&nbsp;I could share the recipe with her so&nbsp;she could make it&nbsp;for a&nbsp;work potluck. I&nbsp;told her sorry, but this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;secret family recipe. She asked if&nbsp;we&nbsp;already considered family. I&nbsp;replied according to&nbsp;you, we&nbsp;aren’t. After that, she went, “oh, ok,” and then left.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1ea/bc9/e2022350ce9c2ad81042974c5d.jpg><p>After everyone was gone, Nick told me&nbsp;I was being cruel. I&nbsp;reminded him that his mother was the one who said&nbsp;I wasn’t family first, and she can’t pick and choose when we&nbsp;are. He&nbsp;said that was a&nbsp;completely different situation, and&nbsp;I was being petty. He&nbsp;left after that and has been cold to&nbsp;me&nbsp;for several days. I&nbsp;don’t see how I’m in&nbsp;the wrong here, it’s ok&nbsp;for his mother to&nbsp;deny me&nbsp;something because we’re not family, but when I&nbsp;do it, I’m wrong?</p><p><h2>She shared an&nbsp;update on&nbsp;the situation.</h2></p><p>I&nbsp;talked with Nick and his mom. After all, we’ve been through&nbsp;it. Hearing her say I’m not family to&nbsp;my&nbsp;face hurt, I&nbsp;explained how I’d been hurt. And it&nbsp;made me&nbsp;feel even worse when she only considered me&nbsp;a&nbsp;family when she wanted something from&nbsp;me. His mom apologized and said she didn’t mean it&nbsp;would come out that way. She was trying to&nbsp;say the trip is&nbsp;like a&nbsp;reward for marriage or&nbsp;an&nbsp;official welcome gift.</p><p>Nick apologized, too, saying he&nbsp;didn’t know what his mom told&nbsp;me. He&nbsp;thought she just told me&nbsp;I couldn’t come and not that she didn’t consider me&nbsp;family. He&nbsp;admitted that seeing his mom sad overrode the rational part of&nbsp;his brain, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;didn’t stop thinking and immediately reacted in&nbsp;anger. Although we&nbsp;talked it&nbsp;out, Nick and his mom are walking on&nbsp;eggshells around&nbsp;me, not sure if&nbsp;this is&nbsp;better than them giving me&nbsp;the cold shoulder, though.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/429/1b1/91cab45839a1bef87c88e64d5c.jpg><p><h2>She received a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;encouragement and support from the Reddit community.</h2></p><ul><li>“‘I couldn’t imagine being together for 4&nbsp;years and finding out they don’t see you as&nbsp;family. My&nbsp;husband’s mom welcomed me&nbsp;into theirs the first time&nbsp;I ever met her&nbsp;— 3&nbsp;months into dating! If&nbsp;she had treated me&nbsp;like this years into being together and my&nbsp;husband was okay with&nbsp;it, I&nbsp;definitely would have rethought my&nbsp;standing, not just in&nbsp;his family’s eyes but his as&nbsp;well. It’s not just about a&nbsp;recipe or&nbsp;a&nbsp;trip, it’s about how they view you.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>haillordvecna&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“You’re only in&nbsp;the wrong because they’re hypocrites. With normal people, there would be&nbsp;no&nbsp;problem. I’d ask Nick to&nbsp;explain how it’s a&nbsp;completely different situation. Family trips are for family. You aren’t family (according to&nbsp;her). Family recipes are for the family. She isn’t family (according to&nbsp;her). Make it&nbsp;make sense!” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>inFinEgan&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“Let’s analyze that last part again. Your BF’s mother told you that you aren’t family, and your&nbsp;BF didn’t object. He&nbsp;didn’t stand up&nbsp;for you. He&nbsp;didn’t stay home in&nbsp;solidarity. This is&nbsp;very revealing. Are you sure you really want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> with someone who is&nbsp;apparently quite comfortable with letting you be&nbsp;excluded? I&nbsp;feel you’ve been given important information about this man and his family, and it’s not attractive. If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;continue with this relationship, I&nbsp;think couples counseling is&nbsp;in&nbsp;order. If&nbsp;he&nbsp;won’t go, go&nbsp;without him and talk this out with a&nbsp;neutral third party.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>CPSue&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>Family conflicts are not uncommon.

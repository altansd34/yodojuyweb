There is a need to give and receive it. It is the essence of who we are, only that it does not always come easy. It is a journey of a lifetime that is worth embarking on. These <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Brene Brown quotes</a> will help you get a better understanding of what love is about.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/16bf19d6905c7dff.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Inspiring Prince quotes and lyrics about love, life and music</span></p></a><p class=align-left>1. We cultivate love when we allow our most vulnerable and powerful selves to be deeply seen and known, and when we honor the spiritual connection that grows from that offering with trust, respect, kindness, and affection.</p><p class=align-left>2. Love is not something we give or get; it is something that we nurture and grow, a connection that can only be cultivated between two people when it exists within each one of them – we can only love others as much as we love ourselves.</p><p class=align-left>3. What’s the greater risk? Letting go of what people think – of letting go of how I feel, what I believe, and who I am?</p><p class=align-left>4. Waking up every day and loving someone who may or may not love us back, whose safety we can’t ensure, who may stay in our lives or may leave without a moment’s notice, who may be loyal to the day they die or betray us tomorrow – that’s vulnerability.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/235ba67697918c2e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best quotes about helping others that will tug at your compassion</span></p></a><p class=align-left>5. Daring to set boundaries is about having the courage to love ourselves, even when we risk disappointing others.</p><p class=align-left>6. When you get to a place where you understand that love and belonging, your worthiness is a birthright and not something you have to earn, anything is possible.</p><p class=align-left>7. I can encourage my daughter to love her body, but what really matters are the observations she makes about my relationship with my own body.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/16bf19d6905c7dff.jpg><p class=align-left>8. Love will never be certain, but after collecting thousands of stories, I’m willing to call this a fact: A deep sense of love and belonging is an irreducible need of all men, women, and children. We are biologically, cognitively, physically, and spiritually wired to love, to be loved, and to belong.</p><p class=align-left>9. Those who have a strong sense of love and belonging have the courage to be imperfect.</p><p class=align-left>10.

Brene Brown quotes vulnerability as a means to expand perception. What does Brene Brown say about vulnerability? Check out <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">her perspective</a> about this subject matter here:</p><p class=align-left>11. Vulnerability is about showing up and being seen. It’s tough to do that when we’re terrified about what people might see or think.</p><p class=align-left>12. Only when we are brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of light.</p><p class=align-left>13. Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity, and change.</p><p class=align-left>14. Through my research, I found that vulnerability is the glue that holds relationships together. It’s the magic sauce.</p><p class=align-left>15. Vulnerability is not weakness. And that myth is profoundly dangerous.</p><p class=align-left>16. Owning our story can be hard but not nearly as difficult as spending our lives running from it. Embracing our vulnerabilities is risky but not nearly as dangerous as giving up on love and belonging and joy—the experiences that make us the most vulnerable. Only when we are brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6f02ec4e30b683a4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50 of the best women empowerment quotes to inspire you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>17. We cultivate love when we allow our most vulnerable and powerful selves to be deeply seen and known, and when we honor the spiritual connection that grows from that offering with trust, respect, kindness, and affection.</p><p class=align-left>18. Authenticity is a collection of choices that we have to make every day. It’s about the choice to show up and be real. The choice to be honest. The choice to let our true selves be seen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/235ba67697918c2e.jpeg><p class=align-left>19. If we want greater clarity in our purpose or deeper and more meaningful spiritual lives, vulnerability is the path.</p><p class=align-left>20. Vulnerability sounds like truth and feels like courage.</p><h2>Brene Brown shame quotes</h2><p class=align-left>Shame is a deadly weapon that kills faster than a gun. It could push its victim to any length. However, it is more disheartening when humanity contributes to its effect out of the negligence of the consequences. Brene is of the mindset that we would connect more when we know the impact of shame and possess a sense of empathy towards others. Here are some of Brene Brown's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">quotes on shame</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7034938673908e99.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top Mary Oliver quotes that will change your worldview</span></p></a><p class=align-left>21. Shame is the most powerful, master emotion. It’s the fear that we’re not good enough.</p><p class=align-left>22. Shame, blame, disrespect, betrayal, and the withholding of affection damage the roots from which love grows. Love can only survive these injuries if they are acknowledged, healed and rare.</p><p class=align-left>23. If we can share our story with someone who responds with empathy and understanding, shame can’t survive.</p><p class=align-left>24. Shame corrodes the very part of us that believes we are capable of change.</p><p class=align-left>25. If we share our shame story with the wrong person, they can easily become one more piece of flying debris in an already dangerous storm.</p><p class=align-left>26. You are imperfect, you are wired for struggle, but you are worthy of love and belonging.</p><p class=align-left>27. Because true belonging only happens when we present our authentic, imperfect selves to the world, our sense of belonging can never be greater than our level of self-acceptance.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/74517fe8cf2ae226.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best be kind quotes to start your day with</span></p></a><p class=align-left>28.Those who feel lovable, who love, and who experience belonging simply believe they are worthy of love and belonging.</p><p class=align-left>29. Shame derives its power from being unspeakable.</p><p class=align-left>30. We live in a world where most people still subscribe to the belief that shame is a good tool for keeping people in line. Not only is this wrong, but it’s dangerous.</p><p class=align-left>Brene Brown quotes on vulnerability, shame and love are an outcome of her dedication for nearly twenty years. So, hope you find solace in these quotes by Brene Brown each time you are faced with a challenging situation or the other. Also, it will not be a bad idea if you share any of them with anyone around you who feels shamed, vulnerable or longs for love.</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnR9lG9pbmVjZXqjvsSnnGaaoqTEr3nQrqatnaNiubDCxGatrqSemr%2BirsiloK2xXai1ornEZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./6-performers-who-didnt-get-a-single-chair-turn-on-the-voice-but-really-should-have.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>6 Performers Who Didnt Get a Single Chair Turn on The Voice but Really Should Have</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./10-people-shared-real-life-stories-with-unbelievable-plot-twists-817774.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>10 People Shared Real Life Stories With Unbelievable Plot Twists</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

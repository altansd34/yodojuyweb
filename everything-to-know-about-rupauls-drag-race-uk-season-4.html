Here’s everything we know from judge line-up to the divas who will sashay into the werkroom vying for the title.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-judging-panel-guest-line-up>The Judging Panel, Guest Line-Up</h2><p>Another season of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RuPaul’s Drag Race UK</a> is on the rise and so is a new set of judges and queens. There are many familiar faces returning to the cast and plenty of new faces we’re bound to love. Returning to the judging panel this season are recurring judges, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Michelle Visage</a>, Graham Norton, Alan Carr, and of course, RuPaul.</p><p>Throughout the season, nine celebrity guest judges will appear alongside the reoccuring judges. These include British icon Alison Hammond, Ted Lasso actress Hannah Waddingham, singer-songwriter Boy George, model Leomie Anderson and others. It’s reported that the guests will help the queens with challenges.</p><p>Awaited to gag the show with a Strictly Come Dancing twist, Tess Daly and AJ Odudu are in charge of the Snatch Game. This will come before Giovanni Pernice acts as season’s choreography professional. Comedian Aisling Bea and singer/songwriter Cathy Dennis are set to also appear this season.</p><p>RuPaul’s Drag Race Uk Season 4 will premiere on Tuesday, September 22. The series will take place within 10 glitzy weeks, with a dozen of divas competing to snatch the crown.</p><p>With that, who are the queens competing for the title of Britain’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Next Drag Superstar</a>? Let’s find out.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Meet the Queens of Drag Race UK Season 4</h2><p>RuPaul has certainly chosen a colorful batch this season. The drag queens have come from all over United Kingdom to slay on the runway and go all the way to the top.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-baby>1. Baby</h2><p>Baby, 25, from South London. Calling herself Baby to signify that she’s the youngest among five siblings, this “London afro-punk princess” has been doing drag for four years. She studied musical theater, and she is more than prepared to show off her dancing and singing skills in the runway.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Black Peppa</h2><p>Black Peppa, 29, is representing the island of Saint Martin. Her fierce style of drag has been known since 2014. Furthermore, her screen name is a spicy twist to Peppa Pig. Dissimilar to the cartoon character, Black Peppa can rock the stage through splits and dips.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Cheddar Gorgeous</h2><p>Describing herself as the “Queen Bee of Manchester,” the 38-year-old Cheddar Gorgeous is the first Drag Race UK diva with a doctorate. Since her early years, she has been obsessing over science fiction and fantasy. As Season 4 begins, we are yet to see if this level of intellect will reflect on the show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Copper Topp</h2><p>Copper Topp is a 38-year-old Cheltenham Spa resident who grew up admiring British icons Julie Walters and Victoria Wood. Her drag is based on her love of pantomime and on shows like Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! and Ab Fab.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Dakota Schiffer</h2><p>This drag queen has always been intrigued by the ’60s and ’90s supermodel era. Sussex resident Dakota Schiffer is a 22-year-old fashion addict. She depicted her hometown as having “absolutely no drag scene.” Hence, she marks history as the first UK drag diva from her locality.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. Danny Beard</h2><p>This 29-year-old Liverpool native is known for her signature white face makeup. Although having a beard is something unlikely for a drag queen, Danny Beard treats his stubbles as an asset. The “sassy, shady, singing cartoon clown” makes it her mission to awe the judging panel by blending avant-garde fashion and old school drag together.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. Jonbers Blonde</h2><p>Johnbers Blonde is a 33-year-old drag queen representing Northern Ireland. This diva has been doing drag for roughly 14 years and characterizes herself as “East London royalty.” Simultaneously with being a queen, he works as a model, fashion editor, and a dancer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8. Just May</h2><p>Popularly recognized for her parody of Ginger Spice, the 32-year-old Just May wants to unlock a personality beyond being a Geri Halliwell impersonator. She expresses her drag style as in a campy and nostalgic manner. Subsequently, this season must expect her to be wilder than ever before.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9. Le Fil</h2><p>Le Fil calls themself the “all-singing, all-dancing, all-sewing Chinese pop star from Brighouse.” This 36-year-old drag diva emerged from underground queer scene and eventually found themself in the global limelight. In three words, Le Fil defines their drag as “androgynous, Asian and sensation!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>10. Pixie Polite</h2><p>Growing fond of Disney and Tinkerbell, Pixie Polite finds it liberating to have such screen name for a large drag diva. This 29-year-old Brighton native is ready to steal the show and not afraid of displaying a strong personality when necessary.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>11. Sminty Drop</h2><p>Inspired by dropping mints and always wanting to kiss boys, 23-year-old Sminty Drop has primed herself to sashay the runway. She believes that she is “literally the embodiment of contemporary British drag.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>12. Starlet</h2><p>Targeting to exhibit vintage beauty on screen, Starlet is a 25-year-old Surrey native who has a great amount of fanbase founded on Instagram. Historically, she is the first South African queen to ever join Drag Race UK.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Original_DavidArchuleta_Paul-ArchuletaGetty-Images.jpg alt="David Archuleta Releases Dance-Filled Music Video for ‘Faith in Me’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>rupaul's drag race</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xK%2Bcq7Gknbavs4ytpmajnqTEbq3BqKytZaKqvaLBy6xknaqRnHqzrcKeZK6jXaiyor%2FOp2RtZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./45755-how-do-white-and-ethnic-minority-views-and-experie.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How do white and ethnic minority views and experiences of knife crime differ?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1549791-does-hayden-christensen-a-wife-a-relationships.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Does Hayden Christensen have a wife?

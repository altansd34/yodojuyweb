She also has a&nbsp;degree in&nbsp;dance from the University of&nbsp;Campinas (Unicamp) in&nbsp;São Paulo, Brazil. Not only that, but she is&nbsp;also the mind behind the school, “Dance For Plus.” There, she offers ballet classes to&nbsp;anyone who wants to&nbsp;take them, regardless of&nbsp;what type of&nbsp;body they have, setting aside all stereotypes imposed by&nbsp;society.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>spoke with Júlia to&nbsp;learn more about her impressive story that shows how she has fought and persevered until the end in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;make her dream come true.</p><p>Júlia started practicing ballet when she was very young: “I&nbsp;started when&nbsp;I was barely 3&nbsp;years old, I&nbsp;was still in&nbsp;kindergarten. Then, when&nbsp;I turned 6, I&nbsp;went to&nbsp;a&nbsp;specialized dance academy. Today I’m 33, so&nbsp;that makes 30&nbsp;years of&nbsp;dancing experience in&nbsp;total. I’ve always danced and always wanted to&nbsp;dance. I&nbsp;don’t remember consciously choosing ballet or&nbsp;even thinking about becoming a&nbsp;dancer because, for&nbsp;me, it&nbsp;was sort of&nbsp;the obvious thing to&nbsp;do, I&nbsp;always wanted to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;can’t really split my&nbsp;life from dancing, they’re one and the same thing.”</p><p>At&nbsp;first, Júlia found it&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;match 2&nbsp;things that seemed opposite: a&nbsp;dance style that was seemingly created for people with an&nbsp;extremely thin and slender body and her own curvy figure.</p><p>“I&nbsp;started with ballet at&nbsp;a&nbsp;very young age and had no&nbsp;problem getting into&nbsp;it. But as&nbsp;a&nbsp;teenager, the way&nbsp;I was treated changed because even though&nbsp;I was thin, I&nbsp;didn’t fall under the category of&nbsp;‘ballerina body.’ My&nbsp;body was curvier than what people expected to&nbsp;see. This limited me&nbsp;in&nbsp;many ways, as&nbsp;some people in&nbsp;the industry would immediately relate that to&nbsp;my&nbsp;ability to&nbsp;dance. It&nbsp;didn’t matter that&nbsp;I had good technique and lots of&nbsp;experience. They’d focus on&nbsp;the fact that&nbsp;I didn’t have the ideal body, so&nbsp;at&nbsp;some point, I&nbsp;also came to&nbsp;think that&nbsp;I wasn’t good enough of&nbsp;a&nbsp;dancer. I&nbsp;didn’t even feel&nbsp;I was worthy of&nbsp;pursuing the opportunities that came my&nbsp;way because&nbsp;I didn’t have the body that people expected me&nbsp;to&nbsp;have.”</p><p>“Since I&nbsp;never really had what people understand to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;standard body, many people told me&nbsp;that&nbsp;I should give up&nbsp;on&nbsp;ballet. People who already danced, friends, or&nbsp;even more distant relatives came to&nbsp;the same conclusion. Fortunately, my&nbsp;desire to&nbsp;dance was always stronger than that, so&nbsp;I was determined and kept going,” she told&nbsp;us. And luckily, she kept chasing her dreams, and in&nbsp;time, she would manage to&nbsp;prove that she was capable of&nbsp;dancing just like anyone else.</p><p>The image portrayed by&nbsp;ballet in&nbsp;general, and especially by&nbsp;its major companies, can easily become counterproductive and even outdated when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;thinking about this activity in&nbsp;a&nbsp;different way. “Such restrictions in&nbsp;how a&nbsp;person should look limits&nbsp;us to&nbsp;think of&nbsp;dancing only as&nbsp;a&nbsp;profession and not as&nbsp;something that can be&nbsp;done for pleasure or&nbsp;fun,” Júlia explained. “It&nbsp;can even prevent&nbsp;us from seeing ballet as&nbsp;a&nbsp;type of&nbsp;<a href=# title=art data-link=tag>art</a> that can make&nbsp;us feel complete.”</p><p>“The standard body that is&nbsp;asked of&nbsp;dancers also has a&nbsp;lot to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with trends. Today, we’ve finally come to&nbsp;realize that an&nbsp;extremely thin body can often be&nbsp;an&nbsp;unhealthy thing to&nbsp;ask for, but it&nbsp;wasn’t always like that. In&nbsp;fact, that still leads many dancers to&nbsp;push their physical limits just to&nbsp;meet such a&nbsp;standard.”</p><p>Júlia has her own dance school, which she opened a&nbsp;few years ago. “When I&nbsp;started to&nbsp;post my&nbsp;pictures and videos as&nbsp;a&nbsp;model and dancer on&nbsp;social media, I&nbsp;received many messages from people sharing their own experience with dance. In&nbsp;most of&nbsp;these messages, people’s bodies limited them, and in&nbsp;many cases, it&nbsp;even made them quit dancing altogether. There were cases of&nbsp;harassment by&nbsp;other dancers or&nbsp;even by&nbsp;teachers, sometimes even by&nbsp;parents, who sometimes refused to&nbsp;enroll their daughters in&nbsp;ballet lessons just to&nbsp;prevent them from suffering from discrimination,” said Júlia.</p><p>“Since I’m an&nbsp;educator with a&nbsp;degree in&nbsp;dance, I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;apply my&nbsp;knowledge and the principles&nbsp;I was already using to&nbsp;teach classes, but this time, for the plus-sized public or&nbsp;for the people who did not feel comfortable and represented by&nbsp;traditional dance schools. For&nbsp;me, dance and ballet are made for everyone, so&nbsp;creating ’<a href=#>Dance For Plus</a>’ was a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;put this philosophy into practice.”</p><p>“’Dance For Plus’ is&nbsp;a&nbsp;concept that goes beyond having a&nbsp;certain number of&nbsp;students and an&nbsp;online school. It’s a&nbsp;<a href=# title=community data-link=tag>community</a> that proves to&nbsp;the world that dance doesn’t have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;punishment to&nbsp;your body or&nbsp;something that you do&nbsp;to&nbsp;look like what others expect you to&nbsp;look like. Instead, it’s a&nbsp;fun, pleasurable activity that brings well-being. Dance For Plus is&nbsp;a&nbsp;place to&nbsp;enjoy this wonderful art form as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;possible. It&nbsp;has a&nbsp;different approach than traditional academies,” Júlia explained when we&nbsp;asked about her school, where anyone can now take classes online.</p><p>New generations are making a&nbsp;difference in&nbsp;the world, and one can only hope that in&nbsp;the near future no&nbsp;one will have to&nbsp;suffer from discrimination or&nbsp;feel uncomfortable with their own body when thinking about dancing. “You need to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;welcoming place that accepts your figure as&nbsp;it&nbsp;is,” Júlia said. “No&nbsp;one can evolve if&nbsp;they are in&nbsp;a&nbsp;pressured environment, especially if&nbsp;their goal isn’t to&nbsp;practice dance at&nbsp;a&nbsp;professional level. A&nbsp;trained professional who knows how to&nbsp;deal with different types of&nbsp;bodies, and by&nbsp;this I’m referring to&nbsp;the instructor but also to&nbsp;the school staff, can really make a&nbsp;difference.”</p><p>“Just do&nbsp;it. Don’t expect everything to&nbsp;be&nbsp;perfect or&nbsp;for you to&nbsp;have an&nbsp;ideal body. Don’t put off something that does you good out of&nbsp;fear. If&nbsp;we&nbsp;don’t take risks and don’t give things a&nbsp;try, we&nbsp;will make the mistake of&nbsp;thinking that we&nbsp;can never get it&nbsp;right. Yet it’s possible to&nbsp;work on&nbsp;motor coordination, flexibility, and rhythm. The accomplishment of&nbsp;doing what triggers you should not be&nbsp;put on&nbsp;hold,” said Júlia in&nbsp;a&nbsp;final piece of&nbsp;advice. Undoubtedly, this is&nbsp;an&nbsp;inspiring way to&nbsp;encourage people to&nbsp;do&nbsp;what they want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;without being influenced by&nbsp;what society throws at&nbsp;them.</p><p>Did you ever feel discriminated against when you wanted to&nbsp;practice a&nbsp;sport or&nbsp;enter a&nbsp;profession? Why do&nbsp;you think that happened? Would you give it&nbsp;a&nbsp;try again today?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5uvMuuqmarma%2Bybq7ApaOeqpmjrm6%2Fx5qpnpxdnbKzecmorKumla56tbuMqamorpViu7DAjKilpbFdpbKzssScq2aan5m2pr%2BMnJinZZSWu6SxjHFnamhjanw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alex-oxlade-chamberlain.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain popularity &amp;amp; fame</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1462652-a-bridgerton-affair-sharon-ooja-5-serve-glamour-vintage-high-society-fashion.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>A Bridgerton Affair: Sharon Ooja, 5 others serve glamour in vintage high society fashion</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

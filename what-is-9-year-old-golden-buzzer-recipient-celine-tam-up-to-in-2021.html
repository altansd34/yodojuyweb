She is now 13 years-old and is keeping busy since her AGT days. Let’s break down everything she’s been up to since she competed on the show.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-brief-history-of-celine-s-time-on-talent-shows>A Brief History of Celine’s Time on Talent Shows</h2><p>This powerhouse vocalist was born in Hong Kong and began singing at only three years-old. It’s pretty fitting that she began so early since her father is a vocal coach. He committed himself to his daughter’s musical career after hearing her belt a Celine Dion song.</p><p>As Tam got older, she became known as the “Celine Dion of Hong Kong,” when she entered various singing competitions. Before going worldwide, Tam began by entering contests and expos all located in Hong Kong. In 2014, she auditioned for China’s Got Talent and made it to the final round. Even though she was pretty successful on this show, she didn’t gain worldwide recognition until America’s Got Talent in 2017.</p><p>Tam was nine years-old at the time of her audition. She stole the heart of America when she sang “My Heart will go on” by Celine Dion. She received a standing ovation, but didn’t get her Golden Buzzer quite yet. Tam came back for the judge cuts and received a Golden Buzzer from guest judge, Laverne Cox. Cox was amazed at the singer’s rendition of “How am I Supposed to Live Without You” by Michael Bolton, so she sent Tam right into the quarterfinals.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><p>Tam did well in the quarterfinals, but she took on a few songs that were a bit too big for her at such a young age. She finished the show out as a semifinalist after performing “How far I’ll go” from Moana. <a href=#>Simon Cowell</a> felt that this was the perfect song for the young singer, but America didn’t agree.</p><p>After her elimination, Tam thanked her new fans for joining her journey. A few days after this tweet, Celine Dion retweeted Tam’s post and invited her to her show in Las Vegas.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-celine-tam-advocates-on-behalf-of-global-education>Celine Tam Advocates on Behalf of Global Education</h2><p>While on the show, Tam began to write and compose her own music. This is really where her career took a turn since she began performing original songs. In 2019, she took her new talent to the stage of World’s Got Talent and received yet another <a href=# class=broken_link>Golden Buzzer</a>. Tam became a finalist that year after auditioning with an original song, which is pretty rare.</p><p>Nowadays, her schedule is still pretty packed when she isn’t performing or attending school like a normal kid, she is quite the little activist. In 2020, Tam posted a detailed YouTube video centered around advocating against animal products. Within the video, she goes into detail to describe the process behind obtaining some of your favorite foods and cosmetic products. It’s so obvious that Tam is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about this topic.</p><p>Last year, she announced that she had become a Room to Read ambassador. Room to Read is a global non-profit focused on literacy and girls’ education. This foundation hopes to bring education (schools and libraries) to countries that currently lack the means to create them. As an ambassador, Tam participates in fundraisers that advocate for gender equality in literacy.</p><p>Most recently, she has become an author at only 13 years-old. Her story, titled “Harper,” raises awareness about the harmful effects of bullying. On her website and Instagram, Celine writes about the high percentages of people who fall into depression for this reason. In an act of charity, all of the proceeds from the project are being donated to CODA Hong Kong, an organization dedicated to enhancing the lives of children with deaf parents.&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MS-S6_MALLARD_BACKDROP_V3-e1633448774973.jpg alt="Who is the Mallard? ‘The Masked Singer’ Prediction + Clues Decoded!" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>celine tam</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGYrWWZqHp6ediemKtln6GxbrPOpZuepl2XwrvGxKtkq52Tnr2qsc2tZJydnJ67pnnTmqRmraBiwbB5yKdka2hiZnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-the-actors-from-13-going-on-30-are-up-to-16-years-after-the-movies-release-797820.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What the Actors From 13 Going on 30 Are Up to 16 Years After the Movies Release</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-to-the-rapping-rabbi-who-fooled-simon-cowell-on-bgt.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What happened to the Rapping Rabbi Who Fooled Simon Cowell on 'BGT'?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

Who wouldn’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;relate to&nbsp;poor teenage Jenna, who just wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;popular and pretty girl? And even more so&nbsp;with 30-year-old Jenna, when everything she wanted had actually come true, but she still wasn’t happy with what she had because it&nbsp;obviously wasn’t what she really wanted! If&nbsp;you laughed and were moved by&nbsp;this beautiful romantic comedy, you’ll probably want to&nbsp;see how these actors look today.</p><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;tribute to&nbsp;this movie,<strong> Bright Side</strong> thought it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good idea to&nbsp;show you how the actors from this movie, that touched and moved our generation, look now and what they’re up&nbsp;to. Let’s take a&nbsp;look!</p><p><h2>1. Jennifer Garner (Jenna Rink)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1fc/044/be67105ccb8d1865f204541985.jpg><p>We&nbsp;love her for her performance in&nbsp;this film. The truth is&nbsp;that playing a&nbsp;30-year-old woman with the mentality of&nbsp;a&nbsp;13-year-old girl cannot be&nbsp;easy, but she did a&nbsp;great job playing such a&nbsp;complex character. Garner was then involved in&nbsp;several films and series, like Elektra or&nbsp;the character Vanessa Loring in&nbsp;Juno, but without a&nbsp;doubt, she got the most recognition after working on&nbsp;ABC’s spy-thriller Alias, a&nbsp;series where she played character Sydney Bristow, which won her a&nbsp;<a href=#>Golden Globe</a>.</p><p><h2>2. Christa B. Allen (young Jenna Rink)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/839/bbe/3f18205b7f8aa8d29cc4cb05fd.jpg><p>Her most popular role was precisely the one she played in&nbsp;this film. However, because she bears a&nbsp;great resemblance to&nbsp;<a href=# title="Jennifer Garner" data-link=tag>Jennifer Garner</a> (you can see&nbsp;it, right?), 13&nbsp;Going on&nbsp;30&nbsp;wasn’t the only film in&nbsp;which she played together with her as&nbsp;a&nbsp;younger version of&nbsp;Garner’s character. In&nbsp;Ghosts of&nbsp;Girlfriends Past she also brought a&nbsp;<a href=#>younger version</a> of&nbsp;Garner to&nbsp;the big screen, playing teenage Jenny.</p><p><h2>3. Mark Ruffalo (Matt Flamhaff)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/47d/701/a8d9e9549095588cd355f203da.jpg><p>Besides being eternally in&nbsp;love with Jenna, his childhood sweetheart, Mark is&nbsp;well-known worldwide for having played the <a href=#>Hulk</a> in&nbsp;several films from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. His last part was in&nbsp;the HBO <a href=#>series</a> I&nbsp;Know This Much Is&nbsp;True, where we&nbsp;can see him playing his own double, since he&nbsp;played both Thomas and Dominick Birdsey, 2&nbsp;twin brothers.</p><p><h2>4. Sean Marquette (young Matt Flamhaff)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0ca/5ad/fca50e52619794b988e7c3beb5.jpg><p>In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;13&nbsp;Going on&nbsp;30, Marquette worked on&nbsp;ABC’s <a href=#>All My&nbsp;Children</a>, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;Lizzie McGuire, among other series. He&nbsp;has also done <a href=#>voice</a> work on&nbsp;several video game and animated series characters like Nickelodeon’s Rocket Power. What a&nbsp;multi-faceted artist!</p><p><h2>5. Judy Greer (Lucy “Tom-Tom” Wyman)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a98/16c/7f1cef555e909123348df35ca4.jpg><p>Greer has had a&nbsp;<a href=#>long</a> career, both in&nbsp;film and on&nbsp;television series, although she has <a href=#>not received any</a> Emmy or&nbsp;Oscar nominations so&nbsp;far. She is&nbsp;an&nbsp;avid reader and shares her book reviews via her <a href=#>Instagram</a> account. She is&nbsp;also an&nbsp;animal lover, especially of&nbsp;her little dog <a href=#>Mary</a>, so&nbsp;she likes to&nbsp;spread the word and promote responsible practices toward animals, like <a href=#>pet adoption</a>. Let’s hear it&nbsp;for Judy!</p><p><h2>6. Alexandra Kyle (young Lucy “Tom-Tom” Wyman)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c2b/5f4/dde5f8504c8655e78d89bd6e06.jpg><p>Little Tom-Tom continued to&nbsp;work in&nbsp;the film <a href=#>industry</a>, but unfortunately none of&nbsp;her projects have really been successful. Before playing the young Judy Greer, she took part in&nbsp;Eye for an&nbsp;Eye and A&nbsp;Time to&nbsp;Kill. Today she looks very much like the young Lucy. It’s like time hasn’t passed at&nbsp;all, don’t you think?</p><p><h2>7. Andy Serkis (Richard Kneeland)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/517/22b/14476155109b68a2218d259e07.jpg><p>We&nbsp;loved him in&nbsp;13&nbsp;Going on&nbsp;30&nbsp;when he&nbsp;put his dancing skills to&nbsp;the test and totally rocked the choreography of&nbsp;<a href=# title="Michael Jackson" data-link=tag>Michael Jackson</a>’s Thriller. That was an&nbsp;iconic moment in&nbsp;the film! But despite his feel for rhythm, later on&nbsp;Serkis decided to&nbsp;specialize in&nbsp;<a href=#>performance capture</a> roles for computer generated characters like Gollum in&nbsp;The Lord of&nbsp;the Rings trilogy, and Supreme Leader Snoke from the First Order in&nbsp;the new <a href=# title="Star Wars" data-link=tag>Star Wars</a> releases, Star Wars: Episode VII&nbsp;— The Force Awakens and Star Wars: Episode VIII&nbsp;— The Last Jedi.</p><p><h2>8. Sam Ball (Alex Carlson)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cb2/d44/ac9fd453c2a43205f922b5264f.jpg><p>He&nbsp;worked on&nbsp;other films like Pumpkin, The Last Castle, and The Pact. However, those of&nbsp;us who love 13&nbsp;Going on&nbsp;30&nbsp;will always remember him as&nbsp;<a href=#>Jenna’s boyfriend</a>.</p><p><h2>9. Marcia DeBonis (Arlene)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a56/822/b3f53d54ed9d729b0ef316fc6e.jpg><p>Jenna’s secretary had to&nbsp;put up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;demanding and authoritarian woman until she was 13&nbsp;again&nbsp;— how will we&nbsp;ever forget the scared look on&nbsp;her face every time she addressed her boss! Marcia also appeared in&nbsp;<a href=#>other films</a>, like Whatever Works, Letters to&nbsp;Juliet, and Baron Cohen’s The Dictator. You might also recognize her mostly for her roles in&nbsp;popular series like Orange is&nbsp;the New Black, The Blacklist, or&nbsp;Almost Family.</p><p><h2>10. Kathy Baker (Beverly Rink)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a99/c51/9c198856a8b41b21f2beca90d7.jpg><p>Winner of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Golden Globe and 3&nbsp;Emmy Awards for her role in&nbsp;<a href=#>Picket Fences</a>, she is&nbsp;also remembered for her performance in&nbsp;Edward Scissorhands as&nbsp;Joyce. A&nbsp;<a href=#>versatile and contemporary </a>actress, she played Jenna’s mother in&nbsp;13&nbsp;Going on&nbsp;30, a&nbsp;character full of&nbsp;wisdom and understanding.</p><p><h2>11. Phil Reeves (Wayne Rink)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5eb/418/50c0a55f3686cc689888eec802.jpg><p>Jenna’s dad doesn’t have much of&nbsp;an&nbsp;impact on&nbsp;the film’s plot. However, you might recognize Phil as&nbsp;Charles Swedelson from the sitcom Girlfriends, or&nbsp;even as&nbsp;Vice President Andrew Doyle from HBO’s comedy, Veep. He&nbsp;has also <a href=#>written</a> movie scripts like Happy, Texas and made special appearances in&nbsp;other shows.</p><p><h2>12. Lynn Collins (Wendy)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/16e/433/4b8ba657bcbd843521b877c258.jpg><p>Another actress from 13&nbsp;Going on&nbsp;30&nbsp;who proudly wore the superhero costume to&nbsp;save the world is&nbsp;Lynn Collins. Just like Mark Ruffalo (who actually played her boyfriend in&nbsp;this film) decided to&nbsp;take on&nbsp;the challenge of&nbsp;bringing the Hulk to&nbsp;the big screen, Lynn played <a href=#>Kayla Silverfox</a> in&nbsp;X-Men Origins: Wolverine.</p><p><h2>13. Kiersten Warren (Trish Sackett)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ea0/c37/d8ce80535699361f9103014806.jpg><p>Jenna and Tom-Tom’s hateful enemy, who worked for the competition, also played in&nbsp;Saved by&nbsp;the Bell: Wedding in&nbsp;Las Vegas and <a href=#>Independence Day</a>. Today, she’s using social media to&nbsp;show how much she loves animals, <a href=#>especially</a> her pets.</p><p><h2>14. Renee Olstead (Becky)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/70a/82d/826cc65bc99cd2436f130bfea4.jpg><p>Becky becomes friends with Jenna because they live in&nbsp;the same building. Currently, this lovely girl is&nbsp;a&nbsp;singer who has already recorded <a href=#>3</a>&nbsp;studio albums and has participated in&nbsp;Live 8&nbsp;in&nbsp;Berlin in&nbsp;2005. She also still acts in&nbsp;movies: her last film was Bachelor Lions, released in&nbsp;2018, where she played Evelyn Ross.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Look at&nbsp;how the girls from the “Six Chicks” are doing.</h2></p><p><h2>1. Brittany Curran</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e61/601/01b1f458e08ca434637a82a139.jpg><p>Brittany belonged to&nbsp;the cool chicks from school, exactly the ones Jenna wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;friends with. This great actress unleashed her true potential mainly on&nbsp;<a href=#>TV shows</a>, most of&nbsp;which have become very successful with their audiences, like Drake &&nbsp;Josh, Criminal Minds, Chicago Fire, and now The Magicians.</p><p><h2>2. Brie Larson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/21f/c9b/dd8ad35b1099cc2a65d897b335.jpg><p>Another member of&nbsp;the mean girls club and yet another one of&nbsp;the actresses from 13&nbsp;Going on&nbsp;30&nbsp;who became a&nbsp;superheroine. Brie is&nbsp;known worldwide for her performance as&nbsp;<a href=#>Captain Marvel</a>. She has won multiple awards during her career and, in&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;acting, she is&nbsp;a&nbsp;writer, director, and singer. Let’s hear it&nbsp;for her!</p><p><h2>3. Ashley Benson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6b0/2b6/4bf98558388377727cac8a8568.jpg><p>Even as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child she was well suited for the role as&nbsp;the popular girl from school. Today she has become world famous for starring in&nbsp;the series Pretty Little Liars, but on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;that she worked on&nbsp;<a href=#>several</a> films like Bring It&nbsp;On: In&nbsp;It&nbsp;to&nbsp;Win&nbsp;It, and had appearances in&nbsp;very successful series like Supernatural or&nbsp;How I&nbsp;Met Your Mother.</p><p>Did you remember that actresses like Brie Larson or&nbsp;Ashley Benson were even in&nbsp;this movie?

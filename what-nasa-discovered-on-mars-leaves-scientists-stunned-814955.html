And on&nbsp;April Fool’s Day, isn’t that just the weirdest coincidence? The device captured some images with some rocks that look like dragon bones.</p><p>Now, let me&nbsp;take you back to&nbsp;2012 when Curiosity made its grand entrance on&nbsp;Martian soil. It&nbsp;was like the queen bee of&nbsp;rovers, the biggest and most capable one at&nbsp;the time. And boy, has it&nbsp;been making waves since then! It’s even discovered evidence of&nbsp;<a href=# title=water data-link=tag>water</a> and organic molecules on&nbsp;<a href=# title=Mars data-link=tag>Mars</a>. These findings were giant leaps in&nbsp;our quest to&nbsp;find out if&nbsp;Mars ever had its own little creatures.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/6b0/d4d/b64fc955c283d2e2eedd4fa57e.png><p>But hey, let’s not forget that Curiosity is&nbsp;no&nbsp;spring chicken anymore. It’s been trotting around Mars for a&nbsp;solid 11&nbsp;years, and its heyday may have come and gone with the launch of&nbsp;the shiny new Perseverance rover. Nevertheless, Curiosity still manages to&nbsp;capture our imagination with its knack for spotting familiar-looking rocks.</p><p>From objects shaped like fish backbones to&nbsp;ones that resemble traffic lights, Curiosity has given&nbsp;us plenty to&nbsp;marvel&nbsp;at. But now, the internet is&nbsp;exploding with excitement over the jaw-dropping images from Curiosity’s mast camera. People are going bonkers over what can only be&nbsp;described as&nbsp;dragon bones! One astrobiologist acknowledged we’ve seen our fair share of&nbsp;weird-looking objects on&nbsp;Mars, but this one exceeded all expectations. The current theory is&nbsp;that these unique ripples on&nbsp;the structure were formed after a&nbsp;whole lot of&nbsp;erosion, probably caused by&nbsp;the Martian winds.</p><p>Now, you might be&nbsp;thinking, “Okay, cool, but what’s the big deal about a&nbsp;funky rock?” Well, for starters, it’s a&nbsp;reminder of&nbsp;just how much we&nbsp;still have to&nbsp;uncover about our mysterious red neighbor. While we’re gazing over potential dragon bones and daydreaming about interplanetary adventures, Curiosity has its serious hat&nbsp;on. Its main mission is&nbsp;to&nbsp;gather as&nbsp;much data as&nbsp;possible and figure out if&nbsp;Mars was ever a&nbsp;cozy home for teeny-tiny microbial life forms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/afb/cb6/3d50c65fd0b85ffd3802e15f18.png><p>It&nbsp;isn’t the first time our trusty Curiosity rover has stumbled upon something truly out of&nbsp;this world. Our robotic explorer buddy has also given&nbsp;us a&nbsp;peak at&nbsp;a&nbsp;teeny, tiny rock on&nbsp;the Red Planet. It&nbsp;bears an&nbsp;uncanny resemblance to&nbsp;a&nbsp;fossilized book. Can you imagine stumbling upon a&nbsp;Martian library? On&nbsp;the 3,800th Martian day of&nbsp;its mission, our adventurous rover captured an&nbsp;intriguing snapshot of&nbsp;this unusual discovery. Using its nifty Mars Hand Lens Imager attached to&nbsp;its robotic arm, Curiosity snapped a&nbsp;pic of&nbsp;this rock that looks like it’s been plucked straight from a&nbsp;librarian’s wildest dreams.</p><p>Before you get too carried away with fantasies of&nbsp;outer space reading materials, let’s clarify the dimensions of&nbsp;this rock. While it&nbsp;may resemble a&nbsp;book, it’s pint-sized in&nbsp;comparison. In&nbsp;fact, it’s only a&nbsp;mere 1&nbsp;inch across. So&nbsp;don’t go&nbsp;expecting the next Martian bestseller to&nbsp;hit the shelves anytime soon. It’s more of&nbsp;a&nbsp;pocket-sized edition, perfect for a&nbsp;quick read during interplanetary commutes. Now, before you get too excited about this discovery, do&nbsp;know that NASA officials commented that peculiarly shaped rocks are pretty common on&nbsp;Mars. Also, billions of&nbsp;years of&nbsp;relentless Martian winds have swept away everything except these uniquely shaped remnants.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9b0/bcc/9425b353bcb5d3476c2392f6dc.png><p>Curiosity has quite the eye for spotting unusual formations. Back in&nbsp;February 2022, our rover pal stumbled upon a&nbsp;“mineral flower” with branching patterns that looked like it&nbsp;had been styled by&nbsp;a&nbsp;florist. It&nbsp;measured a&nbsp;petite 0.4 inch in&nbsp;width. And just a&nbsp;few weeks later, on&nbsp;February&nbsp;16, Curiosity managed to&nbsp;capture some rocky evidence of&nbsp;ancient lakes, featuring teeny ripples and waves frozen in&nbsp;time. If&nbsp;you thought Mars was just a&nbsp;desolate red wasteland, think again! Scientists have even discovered larger-scale shapes etched into the Martian surface by&nbsp;ancient water. For instance, there’s a&nbsp;rock formation that bears an&nbsp;uncanny resemblance to&nbsp;the adorable face of&nbsp;a&nbsp;teddy bear. Who knew Mars had a&nbsp;cuddly side? And, to&nbsp;top it&nbsp;off, there’s another rock that looks like the spitting image of&nbsp;the frizzy-haired cartoon character.</p><p>But Curiosity isn’t just about oddities and peculiarities. Remember that time on&nbsp;February 2&nbsp;when the rover unveiled the first clear images of&nbsp;“sun rays” on&nbsp;Mars? Picture this: as&nbsp;the sun dips below the Martian horizon during sunrises or&nbsp;sunsets, its rays create a&nbsp;mesmerizing sight as&nbsp;they pierce through gaps in&nbsp;the clouds. It’s like Mother Nature’s own laser light show!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4d1/7b0/60eafd5f58be144c7cacc474a1.png><p>There are even images online with a&nbsp;so-called “doorway” on&nbsp;Mars! And&nbsp;no, it’s not a&nbsp;secret passage for little green Martians to&nbsp;hop in&nbsp;and out&nbsp;of, if&nbsp;that’s what you’re thinking. The internet went bonkers when Curiosity captured a&nbsp;snapshot that seemed to&nbsp;reveal an&nbsp;object resembling a&nbsp;door. Cue the weird theories and intergalactic excitement! Nothing to&nbsp;worry about, as&nbsp;experts have chimed in&nbsp;with a&nbsp;down-to-earth explanation.</p><p>According to&nbsp;specialists who know a&nbsp;thing or&nbsp;two about Mars geology, this particular structure is&nbsp;most likely the result of&nbsp;natural erosion. Boring answer, I&nbsp;know, but erosion is&nbsp;yet again to&nbsp;blame here. However, some scientists have also chimed in&nbsp;with a&nbsp;dash of&nbsp;humor on&nbsp;the matter. They pointed out that the “door” stands at&nbsp;a&nbsp;modest height of&nbsp;less than 3&nbsp;feet. So, even if&nbsp;we&nbsp;were to&nbsp;believe it’s a&nbsp;doorway for Martians, we’d have to&nbsp;imagine a&nbsp;particular type of&nbsp;tiny extraterrestrial beings, like Martian hobbits!</p><p>But let’s get back to&nbsp;reality, shall&nbsp;we? The consensus among experts is&nbsp;that this “door” is&nbsp;nothing more than a&nbsp;shallow opening in&nbsp;the rock, cleverly crafted by&nbsp;the forces of&nbsp;nature. Those visible layers were likely deposited around 4&nbsp;billion years ago under sedimentary conditions, potentially in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=river data-link=tag>river</a> or&nbsp;a&nbsp;wind-blown dune. The winds on&nbsp;Mars have been hard at&nbsp;work, eroding these layers over time, leaving behind the intriguing features we&nbsp;see today.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4f3/678/788f0851839382c74e5a114a59.png><p>And if&nbsp;you look closely, you’ll notice a&nbsp;few natural vertical fractures scattered throughout the image. These fractures are a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;rocks weathering on&nbsp;Mars, and the small cave-like structure we’ve affectionately nicknamed the “door” seems to&nbsp;have formed at&nbsp;the intersection of&nbsp;these fractures and the aforementioned layers. It’s almost as&nbsp;if&nbsp;a&nbsp;gigantic Martian boulder decided to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;tumble, creating this whimsical cave entrance.</p><p>There’s also a&nbsp;famous Mars crater that’s not just your ordinary, run-of-the-mill hole in&nbsp;the ground—it’s chock-full of&nbsp;shiny opal gemstones! According to&nbsp;a&nbsp;cool new study, those mysterious “halos” of&nbsp;rock surrounding cracks in&nbsp;the Martian crater might actually be&nbsp;made up&nbsp;of&nbsp;water-rich opal gemstones. Can you imagine that? Mars, the planet of&nbsp;bling!</p><p>Curiosity yet again came to&nbsp;the rescue and did some serious snooping around. It&nbsp;seems there’s an&nbsp;ancient, dried-up lake bed on&nbsp;Mars that is&nbsp;teeming with opal gemstones. These objects could be&nbsp;evidence that water and rock have been having a&nbsp;grand old time beneath the Martian surface. Much more recently than anyone had previously thought, that&nbsp;is!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/135/b0f/b6b3a35efc99ebb59828cfe41c.png><p>Now, when scientists start talking about water, you know they’re on&nbsp;the hunt for signs of&nbsp;life. After all, water is&nbsp;pretty crucial for life as&nbsp;we&nbsp;know&nbsp;it. But here’s the catch: water isn’t flowing on&nbsp;Mars anymore. So, these clever scientists have to&nbsp;put on&nbsp;their detective hats and search for geological signs that water once existed there.</p><p>What does opal have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with water on&nbsp;the Martian surface? Well, to&nbsp;make opal, you need rocks with a&nbsp;whole lot of&nbsp;silica and some good ol’ H2O. There’s more! Researchers also dove deep into the Curiosity rover’s image archive and discovered that these opal-rich halos are not just hanging out in&nbsp;one spot. Nope, they seem to&nbsp;be&nbsp;spread out all over the place in&nbsp;Gale Crater, which is&nbsp;like a&nbsp;huge ancient lakebed. So, what did these clever scientists do&nbsp;next? They ran some tests, of&nbsp;course! Using Curiosity’s fancy instruments, they confirmed that these light-colored halos&nbsp;do, in&nbsp;fact, contain opal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9e9/e2d/ca04b45789bb7bc2c5032c2a3e.png><p>All this data and those cool fracture halo pictures from earlier in&nbsp;the mission led the researchers to&nbsp;a&nbsp;mind-boggling conclusion: water must have been hanging out all over Gale Crater for a&nbsp;long time after the ancient lake dried&nbsp;up. This means that life might have existed on&nbsp;Mars and for a&nbsp;bit longer than we’d been guessing. Who knows, maybe even into Mars’ modern geological period, which, get this, started a&nbsp;whopping 2.9 billion years ago.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSprdNmpZqrkWKxqr%2FCqK2eqpWZerC6jKaYq6tdobKiwsSsZKybmZq7tbXSrapmq6Squ6%2Bxw2ZvamxpaoJw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./reviews.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What our students think of us</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-ben-affleck-net-worth-after-splitting-from-jennifer-garner-and-his-latest-buzz-818361.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Is Ben Affleck Net Worth After Splitting From Jennifer Garner and His Latest Buzz</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

One in 10 heterosexual Britons say they are not sure whether friendships between men and women are possible.</p><p>Half (51%) of British men say that most of their friends are male, and two thirds (67%) of British women say the majority of their friends are female.</p><p>Men (36%) are more likely than women (27%) to have an equal number of male and female friends.</p><p>And twice as many men (10%) as women (5%) say that the majority of their friends are of the opposite gender.</p><p>Younger men are more likely than older men to say most of their friends are women: 17% of men aged 16-24 have mostly female friends, compared to 9% of men in their 30s and 40s, and 11% of men in their 60s or older. Women across all age groups are less likely than men to say most of their friends are the opposite gender.</p><p>Half of both men (51%) and women (52%) think it’s equally easy or difficult to make friends with someone, regardless of their gender. Women are twice as likely to find it easy to make friends with women (29%) than men (14%), while men are correspondingly more likely to say they find it easy to make friends with men (26%) rather than women (17%).</p><p>The older people get, the more likely they are to think that it is equally easy to make friends with both genders: from 23% among 16-24-year-olds to 51% among those 60 or older.</p><p><strong>See full results <a href=#>here</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhraGp9dnnYqKygp6Zis7O1xKebrKCZpXq0wNSdsGaokafBbrLOrqlmnqKesq%2Bw0qGgqWWRo7Fusw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./agts-kaitlyn-maher-announces-a-new-single-after-15-years.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'AGT's Kaitlyn Maher Announces a New Single After 15 Years</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-its-good-for-kids-to-wear-makeup-and-what-age-isnt-too-early-according-to-psychologists-809597.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Its Good for Kids to Wear Makeup, and What Age Isnt Too Early, According to Psychologists</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

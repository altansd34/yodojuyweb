Days before the round officially airs on cable and streaming, the show leaked footage from an upcoming battle. Although I wasn’t sure about this new formatting, It’s quite intense.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-team-blake-begins-the-knockout-rounds>Team Blake Begins The Knockout Rounds</h2><p>The singers in the first ever three-way Knockout Round has officially been revealed. Set to air on the next episode of The Voice is Bodie, Kevin Hawkins, and The Dryes. For those who may have missed last episode, The Dryes originally were eliminated following their battle with Bryce Leatherwood, but due to technical difficulties their coach, Blake Shelton, chose to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">save</a> them.</p><p>The leaked footage features <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bodie</a> singing “Better Now” by Post Malone, Kevin Hawkins singing “This Woman’s Work” by Kate Bush, and The Dryes singing “Chasing After You” by Ryan Hurd and Maren Morris. This Knockout truly showed off each of the singers, as the round normally does.</p><p>Bodie showed off his beautiful mid register with his tune. This performance was purely flawless, but was it too safe? He stuck to the same register, without showing off much more of his voice. On the flipside, he sounds just like a well tuned record.</p><p>Kevin’s performance was almost entirely opposite of Bodie. He showed off his impressive range and high tones with the Kate Bush tune. I think this song was perfectly formulated for his vocal range. If Shelton doesn’t pick Kevin, I’d like to see him on Team Legend.</p><p>The Dryes, of course, performed another steamy, chemistry filled tune. This dynamic duo has clearly attempting to redeem themself after last episode’s surprise save. Shelton knew that they had potential, so they could be his pick once more.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Blake Shelton Says “I Quit!” Following Flawless Performances</h2><p>Once it was time for the coaches to comment on the performances, Shelton admitted that each of the singers “did incredible” while they were “supposed to suck.” Clearly, this will be the most difficult pick for the coach to date. The other coaches seemed to enjoy the performances as much as Shelton, since they couldn’t pick the best of the Knockout either.</p><p>At the end of the video, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shelton</a> complimented each singer. He stated that Kevin improved from their rehearsal, The Dryes voices impressed, and Bodie sounds like he’s already an experienced recording artist.</p><p>“You three broke me, I quit!” he said at the end of his comments.</p><p>The end of the clip leaves the viewer on edge for who the country artist will pick. Since this Knockout is so impressive, we can’t wait to see which artist remains on Team Blake. The beginning of the Knockout Rounds on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Voice</a> airs on Monday, October 31, on NBC. Make sure to tune in at 8 p.m. ET to see which artist is picked.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Original_AngelicaHale_CherylPorter.jpg alt="‘AGT’ Alum Angelica Hale Takes Vocal Lessons From Cheryl Porter" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmec%2BrnKahlaeytHnFoqmsrF2aw6a%2BjK2fq52VYsSixYykpaibm6TCtXnRqKynnF2eu264xJqinpxdm7ywwMCgnGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./10-of-the-most-extreme-beauty-trends-throughout-history-812217.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 of the Most Extreme Beauty Trends Throughout History</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-masked-singer-season-6-winner-jewel-returns-to-the-show-to-perform-standing-still.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'The Masked Singer' Season 6 Winner, Jewel Returns to The Show to Perform 'Standing Still'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

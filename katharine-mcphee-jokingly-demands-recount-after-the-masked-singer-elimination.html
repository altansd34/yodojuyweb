It was revealed during Wednesday night’s show that David Foster and his wife, <a href=# class=broken_link>American Idol standout Katharine McPhee</a>, were the duo behind the mask.</strong></p><p><a href=#>Group B’s finale</a> was held last night for Season 6 of The Masked Singer. <a href=#>Banana Split</a> put up a hard fight, even performing Stevie Wonder’s “Don’t You Worry ’bout a Thing” with Robin Thicke. Banana Split’s song selections throughout the competition showcased a powerful voice that left most of the judges sure that the famous couple were under the masks.</p><p>During their appearance on The Nick Cannon Show after their unmasking, Foster championed his wife and why it was so great being on a show like The Masked Singer.</p><p>“The greatest thing about this show for us was for Kat. She is a triple threat. She can sing, she can act and she can dance. She got to do all of it and under the guise of the mask, which is liberating,” Foster said.</p><p>The bonds that the couple formed on the show made losing difficult to accept. They jokingly demanded a recount of the votes.</p><p>“I hate to lose,” Katharine said. “We had an incredible experience and bonded with so many people behind the scenes on the show. We really loved it.”</p><p>When asked why they chose the Banana Split costume, the new parents showed that they still had their wits about them: “Banana is Foster, come on Nick,” McPhee said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-david-foster-was-supposed-to-sing-on-the-masked-singer>David Foster Was Supposed to Sing on The Masked Singer</h2><p>The response seemed to go over many of the audience member’s heads. Even Cannon laughed and said he just now put it together. During their conversation, the couple also mentioned that Foster was actually supposed to sing once they reached a certain level on the show, but he fought against it. However, the two proposed an all-star version of The Masked Singer on which he said he would be willing to give singing a go.</p><p><a href=#>Playing the piano </a>live was a great twist for the show. Foster is a 16-time Grammy award winning legend in the music industry. For Season 6, not only did he play the piano while his wife performed, he also helped produce her performances for each show. His style of conducting while playing the piano was a telling sign Thicke said during the finale.</p><p>Banana Split was the runner up behind Queen of Hearts, who is a fan favorite. After last night’s elimination, the finale will see Group A champion, the Bull, go head to head against Group B champion, Queen of Hearts. Tune in at 8 p.m. ET Dec. 15 for the special two-hour finale.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-11.53.51-AM.png alt="Is Nick Cannon’s ‘Miracles Across 125th Street’ a Reunion of ‘The Masked Singer’?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57ypqroZminrumecycp6GdlWK3sLfIp56lsV2Zsq6tzZ2qZqqVmLy2utNmmJ%2Bslad6tbTEZqSaq5uasW6%2FyKeenqpdmrmqucinmK2hn6N8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./apac-leader-approval-country-trajectory-surveys.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Leader Approval &amp;amp; Country Trajectory Surveys October 2023</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1113722-how-cook-nsala-soup-chicken-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How to cook nsala soup with chicken?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

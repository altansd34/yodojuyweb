Since then, this piece of&nbsp;jewelry has gone through many transformations because women always dream about having something special.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;find out the stories of&nbsp;unique wedding rings which have become part of&nbsp;<a href=# title=history data-link=tag>history</a>.</p><p><h2>Queen Elizabeth’s engagement ring</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2a5/92b/98c9a25317b790ed1831774c77.jpg><p>Queen Elizabeth II&nbsp;and her mother-in-law&nbsp;— Princess Alice of&nbsp;Battenberg</p><p><a href=# title="Prince Philip" data-link=tag>Prince Philip</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>proposed</a> to&nbsp;Elizabeth II&nbsp;in&nbsp;1946, and she still wears the ring he&nbsp;proposed to&nbsp;her with. Its history is&nbsp;unique. Knowing about her son’s intention to&nbsp;marry, Philip’s mother Alice <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>gave</a> him her tiara, which was given to&nbsp;her for her wedding. Philip took the diamonds for the ring from&nbsp;it, and also made a&nbsp;bracelet for his bride.</p><p><h2>The engagement ring of&nbsp;Princess Diana and Kate Middleton</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d98/e21/71290c50d2b6104f9c8dba60bf.jpg><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;known fact that Princess Diana wore this unusual ring before Kate. In&nbsp;1981, when Diana and Charles got engaged, the jewelry <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>generated</a> a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;publicity because the ring had been <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>purchased</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;store for $60,000, and wasn’t tailor-made, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;should be&nbsp;done for a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;the <a href=# title="royal family" data-link=tag>royal family</a>. Anyone could buy the same ring, which was contrary to&nbsp;royal traditions.</p><p>But the story behind the ring is&nbsp;interesting and not just because of&nbsp;this. It’s believed that <strong>Charles was </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>inspired</strong></a><strong> by&nbsp;Queen Victoria’s brooch when choosing a&nbsp;ring for Diana.</strong> And this <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>brooch</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;real heirloom that has belonged to&nbsp;the royal family since the middle of&nbsp;the 19th century.</p><p><h2>The engagement ring of&nbsp;Camilla Parker Bowles</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5bf/24c/aeb9ab52fc81111e3b872ca98f.jpg><p>Camilla and Charles’ love affair <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lasted</a> for many years, even when they were both married to&nbsp;other people. In&nbsp;2005, the couple was finally able to&nbsp;make their relationship <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>official</a>, and Charles gave Camilla a&nbsp;ring with an&nbsp;impressive diamond. In&nbsp;the 1980s, the ring <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>belonged</a> to&nbsp;the mother of&nbsp;Elizabeth II.</p><p>However, it’s not known to&nbsp;whom this piece of&nbsp;jewelry belonged before that. In&nbsp;2005, the ring was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>named</a> a&nbsp;family heirloom, but its history was never revealed.</p><p><h2>The engagement ring of&nbsp;Meghan Markle</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e19/f63/6cf0165a7582874b3f5f9990cf.jpg><p>Meghan’s unusual ring <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>consisted</a> of&nbsp;3&nbsp;diamonds on&nbsp;a&nbsp;gold band: a&nbsp;large diamond in&nbsp;the middle and 2&nbsp;smaller ones around&nbsp;it. These 2&nbsp;smaller diamonds once belonged to&nbsp;Princess Diana. It’s interesting that in&nbsp;2019, Markle <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>redesigned</a> the piece of&nbsp;jewelry: the band became thinner, and was covered with tiny stones.</p><p>The initial look of&nbsp;the ring</p><p>The ring redesigned</p><p>The ring was redesigned shortly before Harry and Meghan <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>announced</a> their decision to&nbsp;lead an&nbsp;independent life. Many people saw a&nbsp;hidden meaning in&nbsp;this. However, it’s believed that the woman who recently gave birth simply <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>had</a> to&nbsp;enlarge the ring, and at&nbsp;the same time, she changed the design a&nbsp;little. Plus Markle began to&nbsp;wear 2&nbsp;more thin rings along with her engagement ring.</p><p><h2>The engagement ring of&nbsp;Sarah Ferguson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/793/e65/7afe1f598c91cd13c7c949da75.jpg><p>The former daughter-in-law of&nbsp;Elizabeth&nbsp;II, who was married to&nbsp;the Queen’s second son, wore an&nbsp;unusual engagement ring. It&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>had</a> an&nbsp;oval-shaped ruby surrounded by&nbsp;diamonds. It&nbsp;was rumored that Prince Andrew chose this gem to&nbsp;complement Sarah’s red hair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/70f/230/48be01542b8473bada293022b6.jpg><p>The engagement ring of&nbsp;Princess Eugenie</p><p>In&nbsp;2018, their daughter, Princess Eugenie, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wore</a> an&nbsp;engagement ring that bore a&nbsp;striking resemblance to&nbsp;her mother’s ring. But its main difference was that it’s not a&nbsp;ruby, but a&nbsp;sapphire in&nbsp;a&nbsp;similar shade.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cd3/b13/23f23759b3b9dd76d15475e928.jpg><p>Mary of&nbsp;Teck used to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wear</a> a&nbsp;ring with these stones, and her fiancé <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>died</a> before their wedding at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;28. Princess <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Margaret</a> is&nbsp;believed to&nbsp;have been unhappy in&nbsp;her marriage and she passed away early. She used to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wear</a> a&nbsp;ruby ring too. Sarah Ferguson was the third one, and she divorced Prince Andrew. Since then, the Windsors have tried to&nbsp;avoid rubies.</p><p><h2>The engagement ring of&nbsp;Queen Máxima</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/387/69d/fddcfb5d7fbe5017a6010f22f5.jpg><p>Queen Máxima of&nbsp;the Netherlands <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wears</a> a&nbsp;rare orange diamond engagement ring. This color stone was chosen by&nbsp;her husband for a&nbsp;reason: it’s a&nbsp;reference to&nbsp;the house of&nbsp;Orange-Nassau, to&nbsp;which the ruling dynasty <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>belongs</a>.</p><p>It’s interesting that Máxima wears the ring on&nbsp;both her left and right hand. It’s believed that the reason for this is&nbsp;the difference in&nbsp;marriage traditions because the Queen of&nbsp;the Netherlands is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>from</a> Argentina.</p><p><h2>The engagement ring of&nbsp;Joséphine</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d93/3b5/25a01254dd8171d1f892700759.jpg><p>When 26-year-old Napoleon <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>proposed</a> to&nbsp;a&nbsp;widow with 2&nbsp;children, who was 6&nbsp;years older than him, his family was shocked. However, he&nbsp;loved Joséphine so&nbsp;passionately that he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>insisted</a> on&nbsp;her retaining the title of&nbsp;empress even after their divorce, and continued to&nbsp;provide for her and her children from her first marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7f3/559/b79797519c8a387286a69d5f24.jpg><p>A&nbsp;replica of&nbsp;Joséphine’s ring</p><p>The engagement ring also reflected how deep Napoleon’s affection for Joséphine was. The ring was quite modest because his position was fairly low at&nbsp;that time, but it&nbsp;was still sentimental and extravagant. The ring consisted of&nbsp;2&nbsp;pear-shaped stones: a&nbsp;sapphire and a&nbsp;diamond, which symbolized 2&nbsp;lovers.</p><p>Subsequently, Joséphine <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>gave</a> this ring to&nbsp;her daughter, and <strong>this piece of&nbsp;jewelry was passed down to&nbsp;the descendants of&nbsp;the Empress for another 2&nbsp;centuries</strong>. In&nbsp;2013, it&nbsp;was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>auctioned</a>. The starting price was $20,000, but it&nbsp;was eventually sold for $950,000.</p><p><h2>The engagement ring of&nbsp;Audrey Hepburn</h2></p><p>The first husband of&nbsp;the actress took into account her conservative and elegant style and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>gave</a> her <strong>3&nbsp;rings</strong> that would match&nbsp;it, in&nbsp;his opinion: one in&nbsp;rose gold, one in&nbsp;yellow, and one in&nbsp;white, adorned with diamonds. At&nbsp;that time, this combination of&nbsp;metals was quite unusual, so&nbsp;Audrey was ahead of&nbsp;fashion by&nbsp;at&nbsp;least half a&nbsp;century.</p><p>But, often, Hepburn wore only one ring at&nbsp;a&nbsp;time, which once again spoke of&nbsp;her love for a&nbsp;strict and graceful style. Today the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cost</a> of&nbsp;this set would be&nbsp;about $10,000, which is&nbsp;quite a&nbsp;modest amount for a&nbsp;star like Hepburn.</p><p><h2>The wedding ring of&nbsp;Marilyn Monroe</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/32d/e91/360ed95a30aeecad1138e30e41.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1954, Monroe <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>agreed</a> to&nbsp;marry baseball player Joe DiMaggio. The ring he&nbsp;gave her looked very original for that time. It&nbsp;didn’t have a&nbsp;central large stone, and it&nbsp;was entirely set with narrow baguette-cut diamonds. In&nbsp;1999, the ring was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sold</a> at&nbsp;an&nbsp;auction for $772,500.</p><p>There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>theory</a> that <strong>Joe gave Marilyn one ring first, and then replaced it&nbsp;with another</strong>. The supporters of&nbsp;this theory say that the first piece of&nbsp;jewelry was a&nbsp;family heirloom of&nbsp;the baseball player’s and he&nbsp;gave it&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hurry because he&nbsp;proposed spontaneously. It’s believed that Joe kept this ring, and gave his wife another one, which was sold at&nbsp;the auction.</p><p><h2>The engagement ring of&nbsp;Grace Kelly</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2ff/ac7/a7b3df53939a66e49635c4d8f0.jpg><p>The first ring</p><p>In&nbsp;1955, Prince Rainier III of&nbsp;Monaco <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>proposed</a> to&nbsp;Kelly. However, he&nbsp;didn’t give her the ring which later sparkled in&nbsp;all of&nbsp;the forthcoming photos. The ring he&nbsp;gave her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>was</a> quite modest and made from alternating rubies and small diamonds. The combination of&nbsp;red and white symbolized the Monegasque flag, and the stones were taken from the family collection.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/41b/575/59c3ce565cbb7bb39dd5beb260.jpg><p>The second ring</p><p>At&nbsp;that time, Grace was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>finishing</a> her work on&nbsp;her last film, after which she planned to&nbsp;leave the movie industry and go&nbsp;be&nbsp;with her husband. According to&nbsp;the movie script, Kelly’s character wore an&nbsp;engagement ring, but not a&nbsp;small one and <strong>the costume designers had to&nbsp;choose a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;fake jewelry for the actress</strong>. Prince Rainier III decided that this wasn’t right, and gave his wife a&nbsp;new Cartier ring with a&nbsp;large 10-carat diamond. This was the ring everyone remembered.</p><p><h2>The engagement ring of&nbsp;Elizabeth Taylor</h2></p><p>This movie star <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>was</a> married 8&nbsp;times, and each spouse seemed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;surpass the previous one with the size of&nbsp;the engagement ring. Actor Richard Burton, whom Taylor married and divorced <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>twice</a>, gave her a&nbsp;33-carat diamond ring.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/921/041/f83a1a5209a96c12ea8dd6c133.jpg><p>It’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>believed</a> that this diamond was faceted sometime before 1920. The first owner was Vera Krupp, but in&nbsp;1959 her ranch was robbed, and of&nbsp;course, they took the huge diamond ring. The loss was found, and the jewel was returned to&nbsp;the owner. After the incident, Vera would keep the ring pinned to&nbsp;her bra at&nbsp;all times.</p><p>After the death of&nbsp;Krupp, the ring was put up&nbsp;for auction and was bought by&nbsp;Richard Burton for $305,000. Taylor showed off the gorgeous ring everywhere she went. After her death, <strong>the ring was named after her</strong> and sold for $8.8&nbsp;million.</p><p>What would the ring of&nbsp;your dreams look like?

It should not be a surprise that talent acts from around the world dream of performing on the <a href=#>stage of all stages.</a> From singing to magic acts, the global talent that is exposed on AGT continues to separate the show from other competitors. Here are some of our favorite global acts who auditioned for America’s Got Talent.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-zurcaroh><strong>Zurcaroh&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>The acrobatic group of Zurcaroh dazzled their way to second place on Season 13 of America’s Got Talent. Founded in 2009, Zurcaroh performed acrobatic twirls and used human bodies as jump ropes. Thanks to judge Tyra Banks Golden Buzzer the group advanced straight to the quarterfinals. After their season Zurcaroh participated in the 2019 Royal Variety Performance in London, in the presence of Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. Performing in front of royalty makes you a winner no matter what.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Bad Salsa</strong></h2><p>Bad Salsa won Season 4 of India’s Got Talent. The dance duo hoped for lightning to strike twice when they dominated the America’s Got Talent Stage. Although they came in the bottom five during Season 15, they left their mark on the biggest talent stage in the world. Bad Salsa’s fast paced dance routine garnered standing ovations after every performance, ultimately helping them secure a spot in the quarterfinals.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Daneliya Tuleshova&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Daneliya was a fan favorite during Season 15 of America’s Got Talent. The 14 year old singer from Kazakhstan wowed the audience during her audition singing Faouzia’s “Tears of Gold.” She won hearts when she spoke about dreaming of performing on the AGT stage. Many viewers thought the young star would take home the championship, but her run ended before reaching the top 5.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Léa Kyle</strong></h2><p>Hailing from Bordeaux, France. Léa Kyle’s quick-change magic act earned her the Golden Buzzer from judge Heidi Klum. She was the first magic act to receive the Golden Buzzer in the audition phase of the competition in 16 seasons. Léa wowed the audience with her performances, which were accompanied by some today’s Pop music hits. Simon Cowell called her the “best in the world” during her finale performance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Dflex</strong></h2><p>Dflex is a Nigerian born contortionist who left a memorable performance on the America’s Got Talent stage. After doing body contortions for his audition, all the judges voted yes to send him to the next round. Unfortunately, Dflex did not make it past deliberations. Fans remember Dflex for his <a href=#>limb bending talents </a>and larger than life personality.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>World Taekwondo Demonstration Team</strong></h2><p>The taekwondo act finished in the bottom 5 in Season 16. The group helped promote taekwondo across the world before hitting the America’s Got Talent stage. In episode three the group won the Golden Buzzer from Terry Crews, sending them directly to the quarterfinals. Their semifinal performance that consisted of acrobatic routines including tricks where members were fully blindfolded, helped advance them to the finals. Even those who have practiced taekwondo for years were impressed by the group’s skill level.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Macelito Pomoy&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>The man with <a href=#>dual voices</a> made our collective jaw drop when he appeared on America’s Got Talent Champions Season 2. Known for his ability to sing in both the tenor and soprano register, he gained worldwide recognition for his unique talent. The Filipino singer finished in fourth place, much to the surprise of his die hard fanbase.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Men With Pans</strong></h2><p>With over 231 million viewers who watched their audition across <a href=#>social media</a>, Men With Pans left little to the imagination during their circus routine. The duo’s Season 12 performance was enough to leave a lasting impression and solidify them in reality TV show history. Performing with just pans to cover their unmentionables, the Act barely made it to the judge’s cut round. During that round the group did not perform, meaning they did not advance. The image still lingers in our minds.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Unicircle Flow&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>With an audition that fans deemed worthy of the $1 million dollar prize, Unicircle Flow left viewers in awe. The Season 16 group act from Japan was eliminated in the semifinals after performing a futuristic theme set to Dua Lipa’s “Physical.” Although judges said the group “<a href=#>stepped their game up</a>” after their performance, It wasn’t enough to make them the champions.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Roberta Battaglia&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>When you leave the original singing competition champion Kelly Clarkson speechless, you should be proud of yourself. Canadian singer Roberta Battaglia was the young singer with a powerful voice. She made it to the finals and had the audience in tears with her rendition of Alessia Cara’s “Scars to Your Beautiful.” Although she finished in fourth place, her future is bright.&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Noah-feature-2.png alt="7 Things You Need to Know About Noah Mac From ‘The Voice’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKacq6GTlsBus86tZK2ZnJq7tb%2BMpqasrF2eurG%2BxKyqoq6VYq6kwNJmnaunnWKus7vUp5tmrJiaeri70aWbaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dwts-theme-nights-we-want-to-see.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'DWTS' Theme Nights We Want To See</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./american-idols-tyson-venegas-joins-haven-madison-megan-danielle-for-upcoming-show.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'American Idol's Tyson Venegas Joins Haven Madison, Megan Danielle for Upcoming Show</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

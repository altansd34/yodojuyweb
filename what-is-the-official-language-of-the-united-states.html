It refers to the government or state language as it is used in judication, legislation and administration. Around 180 countries in the world have an official language and more than one hundred recognize more than one official language. However, the USA is part of neither group.</p><p>Read more about the differences between&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American, British, and Australian English</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>US states with official languages</h3><p>The United States of America doesn’t have an official language on the federal level. They do use English as the primary language for official documents and publications, legislation, orders, regulations and rulings. Yet state laws govern dual-language situations and can require the printing of documents in more than one English, for example, English and Spanish or even French.</p><p>A number of states have established English as the only official language on a state level, while other states recognize English alongside <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">native</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> languages</a><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;30 US states have made English the only official language, while Hawaii recognises Hawaiian alongside English and Alaska has many official native languages.</p><p>The 30 states with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English</a>&nbsp;as the only official language are:</p><p>Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming.</p><p>All US territories have official languages. Puerto Rico has declared Spanish the principal language, but both English and Spanish are official languages. In the US Virgin Islands, only English is official, while American Samoa has English and Samoan. Guam has English and Chamorro has official languages and in the Northern Mariana Islands, English, Chamorro and Carolinian are official.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The English Language Unity Act</h3><p>The English Language Unity Act is a bill seeking to establish English as the US official language on the federal level. Its first version was introduced in 2005 and would require functions, proceedings and publication of federal and state government to be in English.</p><p>The bill never became law, though it passed the House of Representatives in 1999. In 2005, a version garnered 164 sponsors in the House, but the bill died then and again in 2007 with 153 cosponsors. In 2017, House Resolution 997 had the support of 73 representatives. Its senate companion bill had seven senators supporting it, again not enough to pass into law.</p><p>To this day, there is no federal law in the United States of America declaring English or any other language as official on a national level.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How many people speak English</a>&nbsp;and where is it spoken?</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The German myth</h3><p>According to an urban legend, in 1776, a decision to make German instead of English the official language of the USA hinged on only one vote. This is a myth, but it has various kernels of truth.</p><p>Roughly 17% of US-Americans have German forefathers. And there was a vote with a close result, but it didn’t happen in 1776, and it wasn’t on any official language. In 1795, following Congressional debate, a vote ended 42 to 41 against publishing US laws translated into German or languages other than English.</p><p>Find out about the biggest&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">differences between America and Germany!</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXNoKadmV6YvK57xKdmnKeeqbKvwI6wn5qsXZ7AbsDHnmSonpaesKqty2ajmqaXqq6osYyonWasmJp6trrIrZydZaOprrWx0mg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-the-children-of-the-worlds-most-beautiful-women-look-like-816184.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What the Children of the Worlds Most Beautiful Women Look Like</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./we-imagined-what-15-cartoon-characters-would-look-like-if-they-were-adults-and-here-are-the-results-796744.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>We Imagined What 15 Cartoon Characters Would Look Like if They Were Adults, and Here Are the Results</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

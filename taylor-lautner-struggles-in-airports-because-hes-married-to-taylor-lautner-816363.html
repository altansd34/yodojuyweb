Picture both of&nbsp;them sharing the exact same first name&nbsp;— it’s akin to&nbsp;a&nbsp;scene from an&nbsp;offbeat romantic comedy, isn’t it? However, in&nbsp;real life, they’ve encountered their fair share of&nbsp;challenges due to&nbsp;having identical full names.</p><p><h2>The “Taylors Lautner”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a61/476/a1de715fee82a92280576610d0.jpg><p>Taylor Lautner, renowned for his portrayal of&nbsp;Jacob Black in&nbsp;the <i>Twilight</i> series, found his life partner in&nbsp;another Taylor, namely Taylor Dome. Their union was so&nbsp;significant that Taylor Dome took the heartfelt step of&nbsp;officially changing her last name to&nbsp;“Lautner” following their <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>.</p><p>These two lovebirds share a&nbsp;unique situation, and they’re not shy about having some fun with&nbsp;it. In&nbsp;fact, when Taylor Lautner made a&nbsp;cameo in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title="Taylor Swift" data-link=tag>Taylor Swift</a> music video (yep, another Taylor!), the three Taylors decided to&nbsp;recreate a&nbsp;famous meme. The three Taylors—Lautner, Swift, and Dome—came together to&nbsp;humorously recreate a&nbsp;famous moment in&nbsp;pop culture: the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Spider-Man meme</a>. This meme revolves around the concept of&nbsp;discovering your doppelgänger, where two or&nbsp;more identical individuals point at&nbsp;each other in&nbsp;amazement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/65d/1db/7a363e509c831855f4041e9cf9.jpg><p>The Lautners are pretty chill about their lives and marriage. They even run a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>podcast</a> together called “The Squeeze,” where they spill the beans on&nbsp;their adventures. And regarding the name issue, dealing with having the same name as&nbsp;your spouse can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;a&nbsp;head-scratcher. But Taylor Lautner and his wife Taylor have come up&nbsp;with an&nbsp;adorable way to&nbsp;handle this situation.</p><p><h2>Why did she take his last name?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/322/9e5/27daa65dc999fd03139939b243.jpg><p>Taylor Lautner has been in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>romantic relationship</a> with Taylor Dome since 2018. They went public with their relationship that year, and Lautner proposed in&nbsp;November 2021. They sealed the deal with a&nbsp;wedding on&nbsp;November&nbsp;11, 2022.</p><p>To&nbsp;add an&nbsp;interesting twist to&nbsp;their story, he&nbsp;shared that before they tied the knot, his soon-to-be wife, Taylor Dome, a&nbsp;registered nurse, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>had plans</a> to&nbsp;take his last name, so&nbsp;she was going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;Taylor Lautner as&nbsp;well. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;way, they effectively doubled the world’s population of&nbsp;Taylor Lautners!</p><p>Lautner seemed to&nbsp;acknowledge the peculiarity of&nbsp;his bride taking his entire name, humorously <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>noting</a>, “We’re literally going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the same person,” and even calling it&nbsp;“narcissistic.” Despite this self-awareness, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>proposed</a> in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;a&nbsp;neon sign that read “Lautner”. He&nbsp;shared:"I left it&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;her. I&nbsp;told her, ’You can do&nbsp;whatever you want.’ But she wants to&nbsp;take my&nbsp;name, so&nbsp;it’s definitely going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit confusing."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/786/27b/6a3cd95dbc90dcbb79bdc1b144.jpg><p>The two Taylor Lautners also serve as&nbsp;an&nbsp;interesting example of&nbsp;the ongoing debate about whether women should change their last names when they tie the knot, which has been kind of&nbsp;a&nbsp;hot topic in&nbsp;recent years. Take <a href=# title="Jennifer Lopez" data-link=tag>Jennifer Lopez</a>, for instance; she bid “adieu” to&nbsp;her famous name and legally changed it&nbsp;to&nbsp;“Jennifer Affleck” on&nbsp;their marriage license. This decision stirred up&nbsp;quite the discussion among fans and even celebrities.</p><p>When Lopez <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>signed</a> off her newsletter as&nbsp;“Mrs. Jennifer Lynn Affleck,” it&nbsp;left people scratching their heads. Comedian and actor Katherine Ryan, for one, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a> her thoughts on&nbsp;this, saying, “Changing your name makes very little sense to&nbsp;me, but it&nbsp;makes ZERO SENSE AT&nbsp;ALL when your name is&nbsp;Jennifer Lopez.”</p><p>However, while Jennifer Lopez symbolically <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>waved</a> goodbye to&nbsp;her well-known name, as&nbsp;she remarked: “People are still going to&nbsp;call me&nbsp;Jennifer Lopez”; Taylor Lautner (Taylor Dome) has warmly and fully embraced his husband’s identity.</p><p><h2>How their family members identify them.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8ea/878/010f9a51aabb8b206c5cae83b3.jpg><p>The Taylors have found a&nbsp;clever way to&nbsp;deal with the confusion at&nbsp;social gatherings or&nbsp;among family members. To&nbsp;keep things simple and avoid any mix-ups, they’ve turned to&nbsp;their middle names. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;recent <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a> with Taylor Lautner and his wife, the naming confusion that comes with having the same first name in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship was brought&nbsp;up, and it&nbsp;was asked how their friends and family refer to&nbsp;them, wondering if&nbsp;they call him “Taylor” and her “Tay.”</p><p>Taylor (the wife) grinned and admitted it&nbsp;could get a&nbsp;little puzzling sometimes. She explained that they had established a&nbsp;system of&nbsp;differentiation, with her being “girl Tay” and him being “boy Tay.” She mentioned that it&nbsp;had become a&nbsp;common practice, even when they weren’t together.</p><p><h2>The airport struggles</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/268/50f/edb7df50d1ab2830ce74c6ae8e.jpg><p>Still, the couple takes their shared name in&nbsp;stride, often spinning it&nbsp;into funny stories that they can share with their family and fans, making everyone laugh. The actor Taylor Lautner shared the comical situations that arise because of&nbsp;their identical names.</p><p>Taylor Lautner explained that having the same name can lead to&nbsp;confusion in&nbsp;various aspects of&nbsp;their lives, including when they order items online. He&nbsp;humorously <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mentioned</a>, “Now that we&nbsp;officially have the same exact name, packages are becoming tough. We&nbsp;need to&nbsp;figure something out because when I’m buying stuff for her, and she’s buying stuff for&nbsp;me, we’re gonna have some surprises spoiled if&nbsp;we&nbsp;open the wrong Taylor Lautner packet.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ba3/70c/1b36805c89a64b5d3977a3c1f4.jpg><p>It&nbsp;even gets funnier than this. For example, when they travel together, airport security becomes a&nbsp;comedy show. Lautner (the actor) described how airport staff and the TSA would often encounter confusion about their shared names. According to&nbsp;him, they would inquire, “Which one of&nbsp;you is&nbsp;Taylor?” and in&nbsp;response, the couple would humorously reply, “Both of&nbsp;us.” This is&nbsp;also usually followed by&nbsp;another question, “Which one of&nbsp;you is&nbsp;Taylor Lautner?” to&nbsp;which they would amusingly answer, “Also both of&nbsp;us!”</p><p>This situation would sometimes raise security concerns, as&nbsp;Lautner <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “They’re like, ’Ehh, this seems fishy,’ we’re going to&nbsp;send you to&nbsp;security.”</p><p>For the Lautners, their shared name will likely continue to&nbsp;generate funny stories, giving them something to&nbsp;chuckle about with their future kids and extended family. In&nbsp;the grand scheme of&nbsp;things, life’s quirks often turn into its most charming moments, and the Lautners have certainly found a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;make their shared name an&nbsp;amusing part of&nbsp;their journey.</p><p>Taylor and his wife are adored by&nbsp;their fans, having been in&nbsp;the spotlight for a&nbsp;considerable time. The actor has been the center of&nbsp;attention for years, and more recently, he&nbsp;opened up&nbsp;about the body image challenges he&nbsp;experienced while filming <a href=#><i>Twilight</i></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGixcuoqWakkarBr7HRZqqtqqWctK2x0magp2WRnr%2Bxu9GtqmaalZiutr%2FEZp%2Beq12irrO%2ByJ6bZqyfYsGixcuoqWakkarBr7HRZm9qbmNrgHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./meet-the-veterinarian-whose-selfless-acts-have-saved-many-homeless-peoples-pets-809944.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>This Veterinarian Drives Around California and Helps Homeless Peoples Pets for Free</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./shawn-mendes-sabrina-carpenter-fuel-romance-rumors-with-cozy-nyc-date.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Shawn Mendes, Sabrina Carpenter Fuel Romance Rumors with Cozy NYC Date</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

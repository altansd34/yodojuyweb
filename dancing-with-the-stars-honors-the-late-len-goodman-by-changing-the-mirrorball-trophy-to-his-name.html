The decision was announced by executive producer Conrad Green, who expressed the show’s desire to keep <strong>Goodman</strong>‘s memory alive within the dance community.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dwts-renames-the-mirrorball-trophy-to-the-len-goodman-mirrorball-trophy-nbsp>DWTS Renames The Mirrorball Trophy to The Len Goodman Mirrorball Trophy&nbsp;</h2><p>The beloved judge on the show passed away in April at the age of 78 due to bone cancer. His death marked a significant loss for both the show’s cast and its dedicated viewers. His manager, Jackie Gill, announced his passing and emphasized his role as a cherished husband, father, and grandfather.</p><p>Apart from his American venture on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a>, Goodman was also a prominent head judge on the British version of the show, Strictly Come Dancing, for 12 years. His impact on the dance world extended far beyond the television screen. BBC Director-General Tim Davie acknowledged that Goodman’s warm and entertaining persona made him feel like a member of everyone’s family.</p><p>Reflecting on Goodman’s passing, Derek Hough shared his memories of a mentor he had known since he was 12 years old. Hough noted that while they were aware of Goodman’s health issues, the extent of his illness came as a shock. He added that there were many tears and phone calls among those who cared deeply for Goodman.</p><p>Goodman himself had received a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mirrorball</a> trophy during the season 31 finale of the show. It’s an experience he described as “fantastic” and the cherry on top of his wonderful journey with DWTS. The show also paid tribute to his 17-year tenure as a judge with a highlight reel celebrating his contributions.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-more-tributes-are-planned-for-goodman-this-season>More Tributes Are Planned For Goodman This Season</h2><p>The renaming of the Mirrorball trophy is a significant gesture that will ensure Goodman’s legacy remains with the show. Executive producer Conrad Green teased that the upcoming Season 32 premiere of DWTS, airing on September 26 on ABC, will be dedicated to Goodman.</p><p>“The Len Goodman Mirrorball Trophy will now be lifted on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dancing With The Stars</a>.” Green said. “We wanted to make Len a permanent part of this show, to always remind people of the importance he’s had.”</p><p>In addition to the trophy renaming, further tributes to Goodman are planned for the season. These include a retrospective look at his career, video tributes, and special performances. These efforts will pay homage to a man whose twinkle-eyed charisma, brilliant wit, and deep expertise left an unforgettable mark on the world of dance and entertainment.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Original_XochtilGomez_ABC_Andrew-Eccles-220x147.jpg alt="Who Is Xochitl Gomez?

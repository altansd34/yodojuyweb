Transitioning can be&nbsp;very confusing for both the child and their parents, especially at&nbsp;a&nbsp;young age, but that is&nbsp;why those families deserve all the respect and support from the outside world. Luckily, there are famous moms and dads out there who show, by&nbsp;their own example, the ins and outs of&nbsp;raising a&nbsp;transgender child.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side </strong>applaud these proud celebrity parents whose love for their child doesn’t depend on&nbsp;their gender.</p><p><h2>1. Charlize Theron</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0d0/528/bfe33452aa9b608b30140606cf.jpg><p>Charlize’s daughter Jackson was born a&nbsp;boy and <a href=#>came out</a> she was 3&nbsp;years old. The actress was very understanding and happy to&nbsp;have 2&nbsp;<a href=#>daughters</a> (Jackson has younger sister named August). Both of&nbsp;Theron’s kids were adopted.</p><p>As&nbsp;far as&nbsp;Charlize’s support goes, she protects her daughter, but <a href=#>says</a> she’ll let Jackson tell her side on&nbsp;her own time: “My&nbsp;daughter’s story is&nbsp;really her story, and one day, if&nbsp;she chooses, she’ll tell her story. <strong>I&nbsp;feel like as&nbsp;her mother, for&nbsp;me, it&nbsp;was important to&nbsp;let the world know that&nbsp;I would appreciate it&nbsp;if&nbsp;they would use the right pronouns for her.”</strong></p><p><h2>2. Cynthia Nixon</h2></p><p>Nixon <a href=#>presented</a> the new identity of&nbsp;her transgender son Seph, originally born a&nbsp;girl, in&nbsp;2018, when she made a&nbsp;post about his graduation on&nbsp;Trans Day of&nbsp;Action. Seph is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the 2&nbsp;children the Sex and the City star had with her former <a href=#>partner</a> Danny Mozes.</p><p>Cynthia is&nbsp;very supportive of&nbsp;her son and <a href=#>said</a> that his coming out was a&nbsp;relief: “I’m very proud of&nbsp;him... <strong>I&nbsp;felt really weird using the other pronoun in&nbsp;public, but people didn’t know yet. He&nbsp;was good with&nbsp;it, and it&nbsp;was really nice, actually, when we&nbsp;announced&nbsp;it.</strong> There was some general, you know, voicings of&nbsp;support, but generally it&nbsp;was not a&nbsp;big deal.”</p><p><h2>3. Gabrielle Union and Dwayne Wayde</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7c3/4ab/9a389455cdbc6767f535c08ff4.jpg><p>NBA star Dwyane Wade and actress Gabrielle Union do&nbsp;everything they can to&nbsp;make their daughter’s transition comfortable. Dwyane first <a href=#>opened up</a>&nbsp;about Zaya, who lived as&nbsp;a&nbsp;boy for 12&nbsp;years, in&nbsp;2020&nbsp;on The Ellen Show and said he&nbsp;and his wife take their role as&nbsp;parents very seriously and are happy to&nbsp;learn more about what their daughter is&nbsp;going through.</p><p>Wade <a href=#>wants</a> to&nbsp;show other parents that they’re not alone: <strong>“We&nbsp;know there are other families out there dealing with their kid finding themselves and learning who they are.</strong> I’m not going to&nbsp;sit here and act like we&nbsp;have all the answers. I’m not going to&nbsp;sit here and act like before our child came home and sat&nbsp;us down, that we&nbsp;weren’t ignorant parents when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;the world. When I&nbsp;say we’re learning from our 12-year-old, we’re literally learning from our child.”</p><p><h2>4. Angelina Jolie</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2b7/94e/4da12d5853ba789507e0c5e854.jpg><p>The world has been keeping an&nbsp;eye on&nbsp;Shiloh Jolie-Pitt’s changing style for a&nbsp;while now. Boyish style and short hair are Shiloh’s trademark and even though <a href=# title="Angelina Jolie" data-link=tag>Angelina Jolie</a> has never officially revealed her child’s pronouns, she once let it&nbsp;slip that Shiloh wants to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;boy.</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;2010&nbsp;interview, Angelina <a href=#>addressed</a> her daughters style and revealed: <strong>“She likes to&nbsp;dress like a&nbsp;boy. She wants to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;boy. So&nbsp;we&nbsp;had to&nbsp;cut her hair. She likes to&nbsp;wear boys’ everything. She thinks she’s one of&nbsp;the brothers.” </strong>As&nbsp;for now, we&nbsp;respect the family’s privacy and know that Shiloh will come out when the time is&nbsp;right.</p><p><h2>5. Sade</h2></p><p>The Smooth Operator hitmaker’s <a href=#>only child</a> came out as&nbsp;transgender in&nbsp;2016. Izaak, previously known as&nbsp;Mickailia (b.&nbsp;1996), <a href=#>said</a> his famous mom is&nbsp;his biggest support system and thanked Sade for being by&nbsp;his side during this journey.</p><p>Izaak wrote: “Thank you for staying by&nbsp;my&nbsp;side these past 6&nbsp;months Mumma. <strong>Thank you for fighting with me&nbsp;to&nbsp;complete the man I&nbsp;am. Thank you for your encouragement when things are hard, for the love you give&nbsp;me.</strong> The purest heart. I&nbsp;love you so&nbsp;much. Queen of&nbsp;queens.”</p><p><h2>6. Ally Sheedy</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3ba/3f9/da62f1597bb26fd527a68de224.jpg><p>Sheedy, who’s best known for her role in&nbsp;The Breakfast Club (1985), is&nbsp;a&nbsp;proud <a href=#>mom</a> of&nbsp;transgender son Beckett (b.&nbsp;1994), whom she had with her ex-husband David Lansbury. She actively <a href=#>supports</a> the LGBTQ+ community on&nbsp;social media and is&nbsp;vocal about fighting for Beckett’s equal rights as&nbsp;a&nbsp;trans man.</p><p>Ally’s son once <a href=#>shared</a> his thoughts on&nbsp;coming out and gender in&nbsp;general: “Pronouns are something that people just usually take for granted. You never really think about it&nbsp;since the baby’s born. They’re a&nbsp;boy, then there’s no&nbsp;question about how are we&nbsp;going to&nbsp;refer to&nbsp;the child. <strong>It’s really, really nice to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;have that power to&nbsp;pre-plan how you’re identified and how other people are going to&nbsp;see you and identify you.”</strong></p><p><h2>7. Cindy Barshop</h2></p><p>The Real Housewives of&nbsp;New York City star Cindy Barshop <a href=#>revealed</a> in&nbsp;2019 that one of&nbsp;her twins identifies as&nbsp;a&nbsp;boy. The former reality show personality said, at&nbsp;the time, that her 9-year-old Jesse is&nbsp;on&nbsp;his way to&nbsp;becoming transgender and has her full support: “When a&nbsp;child feels comfortable and open, identity issues are able to&nbsp;be&nbsp;discussed in&nbsp;the family environment.<strong> I&nbsp;believe in&nbsp;creating an&nbsp;open and positive home so&nbsp;they are able to&nbsp;express themselves.”</strong></p><p><h2>Bonus: Cher</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e47/923/77d1415da99565d45dd01bd7b1.jpg><p>Cher has done her job as&nbsp;a&nbsp;parent splendidly and supported her son Chaz Bono in&nbsp;his transition. Originally born in&nbsp;1969&nbsp;as a&nbsp;female named Chastity, Chaz began his <a href=#>transition</a> in&nbsp;2008 and recorded his experience in&nbsp;the documentary Becoming Chaz. In&nbsp;2011, Bono took part in&nbsp;Dancing with the Stars and made history by&nbsp;becoming the first transgender person to&nbsp;appear on&nbsp;a&nbsp;reality competition show.</p><p>The famous singer <a href=#>said</a> Chaz’s coming out brought them closer than ever: <strong>“We’re in&nbsp;the best place we’ve ever been since she was young. </strong>And I&nbsp;have to&nbsp;say ‘she’ because Chastity was a ‘she’ then and&nbsp;I have to&nbsp;make the distinction with Chaz as&nbsp;he&nbsp;is&nbsp;now. <strong>But it’s starting to&nbsp;be&nbsp;nice because we’re creating memories now and we’ve actually had the most fun together lately than we’ve had in&nbsp;forever.”</strong></p><p>Do&nbsp;you have an&nbsp;experience with a&nbsp;transgender child?

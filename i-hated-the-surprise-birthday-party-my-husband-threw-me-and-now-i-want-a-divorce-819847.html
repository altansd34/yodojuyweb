Instead, what unfolded that evening exposed the deep cracks in their relationship.</p><p>I (40f) have been married to my husband Sam (41m) for 10 years. We have four children (22,16,14 and 11) and up until the last few months, I genuinely thought that we could work through anything. This is not the only situation that has happened in the last few years, just the one that finally broke me.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9f1/31e/29f0d052ef9485e688dc773c09.jpg><p>I recently had a birthday and Sam planned a surprise birthday party for me. He spilled the beans to me 3 days before the party, and I thought it was adorable that he was so excited about the party that he couldn't contain himself.</p><p>I wish this was the case, instead, he told me that I needed to help him clean the house to get it ready for my party. Yes, you read that right, I needed to prepare food and set up the house for my own party.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/21a/11a/c25cfc503685a861a64aeb2988.jpg><p>I agreed to clean to keep the peace, but I was upset. The day of the party quickly came, and I was devastated to learn that he didn't invite most of my <a href=# title=friends data-link=tag>friends</a> or <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>. He claimed that he didn't know how to contact them.</p><p>The final straw came when he carried out a cake in a flavor that he loved, nothing that I would ever choose for myself. I barely managed to keep it in and cried in the bathroom after everyone left.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d96/fba/9674235d248be45235eecb8ade.jpg><p>I felt like an afterthought and hated listening to everyone compliment him for throwing me a party. I work two jobs, take care of the kids, and plan meals, grocery shopping, and most of the housework. I am exhausted and just want to feel appreciated for a day.</p><p>Am I wrong for considering divorce because I feel he doesn't care? I just can't imagine throwing away 10 years of <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>, but I feel broken.</p><p><h2>People stood on&nbsp;her side.</h2></p><ul><li>"Tell him, 'I hope you enjoyed your birthday party, now I don’t have to throw you one when it’s your birthday.'" <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Old_Beach2325 / Reddit</a></li><li>"The reason for your divorce isn’t a cake or the party. It’s his self-centeredness. He decided to throw a party. The reason he gave his guests was your birthday, but it was for himself.<br>He wasn’t excited about the party and told you early, he needed you to clean and organize everything for it. He only invited his friends and family. Ten-plus years in and he can’t contact your friends and family.<br>He bought his favorite cake. He took all of the accolades and credit. You don’t need someone in your life that has you feeling sad, unworthy, and used." <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Realistic-Animator-3 / Reddit</a></li><li>"His excuse that he didn’t contact her family because he didn’t know their contact info is bunk, too.

Ruth was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed to be Cupcake</a> during this week’s exciting episode. Nicole Scherzinger correctly guessed that Ruth was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">under the mask</a>. Ruth was supposed to perform on the show alongside her sister Anita. She became a solo Cupcake act when Anita pulled out due to health issues.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ruth-pointer-reflects-on-the-masked-singer-experience>Ruth Pointer Reflects on ‘The Masked Singer’ Experience</h2><p>“It was supposed to be two cupcakes, me and Anita, and right on the day that we got fitted for our Cupcake costumes, she got a call from her doctor and it wasn’t very good,” Ruth shared. “So we thought we didn’t want to add any kind of strenuous thing to her situation. So we thought it would be best that I do it without her, so I agreed to do that.”</p><p>Cannon admitted that although he is pretty good with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">guessing who is under the mask</a>, this one threw him off. He knew it had to be someone with a legendary voice. There were so many names being thrown out there like Roberta Flack and Leslie Jones. Scherzinger finally pieced the puzzle together about it being one of the members of The Pointer Sisters.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>“I wasn’t that surprised,” she said. “We had shared a flight a few years back and I think Nicole being a former girl group member, you know, girl groups sort of tend to pay attention to each other and who’s in the group and the voices and all that and I think that probably gave her a little bit of an edge.”</p><p>Ruth also shared a glimpse of what it was like to record the 1985 hit, “We Are the World,” penned by Michael Jackson&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lionel Richie</a>. She said all of the artists involved were told to “leave your ego at the door.” The song ended up winning four Grammy Awards. Ruth is a three-time Grammy winner with The Pointer Sisters. “I’m So Excited” was by far one of the group’s biggest hits. She revealed that it’s her favorite song that they have done.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jonathan-Goodwin-scaled-e1634306983313.jpeg alt="Jonathan Goodwin Suffers Near-Death Accident on ‘AGT: Extreme’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570a6roWWgpLavwMSrZKyZqah6tLTEZqCspqRiwKm7wqScnWWenrCwuMRmqpyglafHqrrGnqlmn6WawLSxw2afnqpdpLtuwMeeZKaZo6CypXnSoqWgnaJk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./scottish-phrases-thatll-get-you-through-life.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Scottish Phrases That'll Get You Through Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./quiz-try-to-guess-these-15-animals-by-their-cute-noses-806969.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Quiz: Try to Guess These 15 Animals by Their Cute Noses</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

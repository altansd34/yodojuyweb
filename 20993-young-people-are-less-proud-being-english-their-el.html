In fact, close to one in ten (9%) young people this age say they are actively embarrassed by their English identity, while a further 34% say they are neither proud nor embarrassed.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Englishness20by20age-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Nevertheless, the vast majority of young people in England do still identify as English (albeit at a lower rate than their elders). More than three quarters (77%) of 18-24 year olds in England identify very or fairly strongly as English, compared to 87% of 65+ year olds. These figures are not far removed from the proportion who identify as British – 83% of 18-24 year olds and 86% of 65+ year olds.</p><h4><strong>Competing visions of England and Englishness</strong></h4><p>The survey also reveals the extent to which the generations differ in their perceptions of what Englishness is and involves, with younger people again taking a more negative view.</p><p>For instance, when asked whether or not they associate a series of characteristics with English identity, young people are consistently less likely to associate Englishness with any of the positive characteristics. While 84% of people aged 65 and over identify a “sense of fair play” with English identity and 74% do so for “generosity”, among 18-24 year olds these figures are only 56% and 46% respectively among 18-24 year olds.</p><p>By contrast, 18-24 year olds are more likely to consider being “loud” a part of English identity than their elders, with 35% making this association – almost twice the 18% of 65+ year olds who do so.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/English20identity202-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Similarly, the factors that contribute to a person’s sense of Englishness differ between the generations. Younger people are far less likely to see England as a “green and pleasant land” – 60% of 18-24 year olds say the English countryside contributes strongly to their English identity, compared to fully 90% among 65+ year olds.</p><p>Likewise, “England’s Christian tradition” and “England’s history and heritage” are much less likely to contribute strongly to younger people’s sense of Englishness than their elders’ (22% vs 53% and 56% vs 89% respectively).</p><p>On the flip side, older people are less likely to consider England’s cultural diversity as a source of their Englishness – the majority (52%) of 65+ year olds say England’s diverse cultural life does not contribute strongly to their English identity (compared to 36% of 18-24 year olds).</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/English20identity201-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Given the above, it is perhaps not too surprising that young people are more likely than the old to see England as a place of diversity (57% vs 47%), as well as one of modernity (20% vs 9%). For their part, older people are much more likely to consider it “a place where history, tradition and pageantry are important” (64% vs 37%), a world leader in innovation, industry and trade (49% vs 26%) and a nation that has been proud to stand alone (36% vs 16%).</p><h4><strong>Find out attitudes to England and Englishness in your council area</strong></h4><p>As part of this project YouGov, working in conjunction with Dr Kevin Cunningham and Dr Ian Warren, enabled the BBC to break down the results by council area - a more detailed level than is usually available. You can see the results for your council area on the BBC website <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p>This capability is achieved through the use of a statistical procedure called "multilevel regression and post-stratification" (or MRP).</p><p>The technique produces estimates for small areas based on a limited amount of data. It uses the people from each local authority to predict that area's results, but to ensure that this small amount of data is representative of the wider population the estimates are balanced out using comparable data from the poll from the rest of the country and the census on the demographic make-up of the local authority in question. You can find out more about how MRP works <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p>Photo: Getty</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full results here</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYmWGen%2BMsqauppdivaa7z6WcZpmimnqtsdKsZKmqn6qxbq7EoqWgZZWjtK210qFkraCVnr9uscs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./agt-star-jackie-evancho-is-channeling-her-the-masked-singer-character-in-upcoming-tour.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'AGT' Star Jackie Evancho is Channeling Her 'The Masked Singer' Character in Upcoming Tour</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./xomg-pop-fans-demand-answers-after-leigha-sanderson-leaves-group.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>XOMG POP Fans Demand Answers After Leigha Sanderson Leaves Group</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

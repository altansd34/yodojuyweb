No, it’s not Heathrow, or Hinkley – it’s what should happen to the Palace of Westminster, the building in which the House of Commons and House of Lords sit.</p><p>Some areas of the venerable building have not undergone any restoration since the Palace was built in 1834. The roofs are leaking, internal plumbing frequently fails, asbestos remains throughout the building and it is infested with mice.</p><p>Earlier this month, the joint committee on the Palace of Westminster released a report that its preferred option for the renovation was to relocate MPs and Lords from the Palace entirely for six years whilst repairs were made.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Parliament20relocation-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>If Parliament has to leave the Palace of Westminster, where should it go? YouGov research has found that 54% of people think that Parliament should leave London, whilst 46% think it should stay in the capital.</p><p>Among those who think that it should leave London, the majority think it should relocate to either the North or the Midlands, which collectively receive 37% of the vote. All other parts of the UK were preferred by fewer than 10% of people.</p><p>There was significant regional variation in the responses. The majority of people living in each part of the South (London, Rest of South and East of England) all thought that Parliament should stay in London. Londoners are particularly fervent, with 70% saying that it should remain in the capital.</p><p>The majority of people in all other parts of Britain, however, all thought that Parliament should leave the South, although there is no real consensus on where it should move to. People in the Midlands and the North were the most keen on bringing Parliament to their own regions – with 45% and 44% in favour respectively – and it was a more popular option in both regions than leaving Parliament in London.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Where20should20Parliament20go-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>By contrast, people in Wales and Scotland – which have their own devolved assemblies – were much more likely to prefer that Parliament stayed put in London (41% and 35% respectively) than come to them (20% and 19%).</p><p>Photo: PA</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full results here</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYWuCcYCMsJ%2BeqpViwKm71KWbZqiRp7mqrcyepa1ll6Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1310129-matt-gaetz-bio-wife-net-worth-age-height-weight-latest-news-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Matt Gaetz's bio: wife, net worth, age, height, weight, latest news</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jimmie-allen-was-surprised-at-his-dancing-with-the-stars-success.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jimmie Allen Was Surprised at His 'Dancing With The Stars' Success</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

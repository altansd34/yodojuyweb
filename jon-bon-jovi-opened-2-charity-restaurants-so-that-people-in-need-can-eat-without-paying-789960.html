He’s also been chosen several times as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most attractive artists and is&nbsp;a&nbsp;determined political activist <span>as&nbsp;well</span>. However, he’s less mentioned for his charity work, even though he&nbsp;stands out on&nbsp;this matter among many celebrities. He&nbsp;owns 2&nbsp;<a href=# title=restaurants data-link=tag>restaurants</a> where people without many resources can enjoy food without paying.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> wants to&nbsp;tell you all about this project that has currently <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>served</a> over 141,118&nbsp;meals. Don’t miss the bonus at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the article to&nbsp;find out about other not-so-well-known facts about this fantastic musician.</p><p><h2>“All are welcome at&nbsp;our table.”</h2></p><p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Jon Bon Jovi Soul Foundation/JBJ Soul Foundation</a> is&nbsp;the name of&nbsp;the nonprofit organization, an&nbsp;institution led by&nbsp;the artist, which holds his initials. At&nbsp;Soul Kitchen, plates don’t have prices, and paying the bill is&nbsp;only optional. Those who can do&nbsp;so&nbsp;are asked to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;$20&nbsp;donation, and those who aren’t able&nbsp;to, even people who are homeless, are also welcomed into the restaurant to&nbsp;eat and volunteer later in&nbsp;the kitchen.</p><p>According to&nbsp;the restaurant’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>website</a>, 47% of&nbsp;the meals they’ve served, to&nbsp;this day, were paid for by&nbsp;donations. The remaining&nbsp;53% were covered by&nbsp;the voluntary work of&nbsp;people without financial resources. That’s why one of&nbsp;the restaurant’s mottos is&nbsp;“All are welcome at&nbsp;our table.”</p><p><h2>Bon Jovi’s love for New Jersey</h2></p><p>The first of&nbsp;these establishments opened its doors in&nbsp;October 2011, in&nbsp;the Red Bank area of&nbsp;New Jersey. This is&nbsp;the city where Bon Jovi was born and after which he&nbsp;named his fourth <a href=#>album</a> released in&nbsp;1988. The second restaurant was opened in&nbsp;2016, near Toms River, an&nbsp;area profoundly affected by&nbsp;Hurricane Sandy, which shook the country in&nbsp;2012.</p><p>“Our mission has always been to&nbsp;<strong>affect positive change</strong> and address the issues of&nbsp;hunger and homelessness,” <a href=#>explained</a> the author of&nbsp;hits like You Give Love a&nbsp;Bad Name and Livin ’on a&nbsp;Prayer when opening his second restaurant. “<strong>There are no&nbsp;prices on&nbsp;our menu</strong>. So&nbsp;if&nbsp;you are in&nbsp;<a href=# title=need data-link=tag>need</a>, you participate. And that means bussing the table, washing a&nbsp;dish, working in&nbsp;our gardens,” he&nbsp;<a href=#>added</a>.</p><p><h2>There are no&nbsp;reservations and tables are shared with strangers.</h2></p><p>No&nbsp;reservations are required to&nbsp;eat at&nbsp;Soul Kitchen. Diners are assigned a&nbsp;shared table in&nbsp;order of&nbsp;arrival, where they can dine, even with strangers. This makes social interaction more natural and smooth for everyone, regardless of&nbsp;their economic conditions. And <strong>all those who are most in&nbsp;need of&nbsp;a&nbsp;hot plate, always have priority to&nbsp;sit</strong>.</p><p><h2>There’s a&nbsp;3-course menu prepared with organic and nutritious ingredients.</h2></p><p>The menu consists of&nbsp;3&nbsp;courses inspired by&nbsp;local American cuisine. The menu changes every 10&nbsp;days. The first course consists of&nbsp;either soup or&nbsp;salad. The main course is&nbsp;usually made with either poultry or&nbsp;red meat or&nbsp;fish, but vegetarian and gluten-free options are also available. And finally, there’s dessert, which varies according to&nbsp;the season. The meals are prepared with nutritious and organic ingredients from the restaurant’s own garden, and the <a href=# title=farm data-link=tag>farm</a> is&nbsp;owned by&nbsp;the NGO.</p><p>You can have a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;the menu on&nbsp;the restaurant’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>website</a>.</p><p><h2>Housing and roofs to&nbsp;“break the cycle of&nbsp;poverty”</h2></p><p>Besides these 2&nbsp;restaurants, the JBJ Foundation has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>built</a> homes in&nbsp;the city of&nbsp;Philadelphia for the homeless, which also includes young people and veterans.</p><p>The foundation, created by&nbsp;the rock star and his wife, Dorothea Hurley, has a&nbsp;clear <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mission</a>: “To&nbsp;break the cycle of&nbsp;hunger, poverty, and homelessness through developing partnerships, creating programs, and providing grant funding to&nbsp;support innovative <a href=# title=community data-link=tag>community</a> benefit organizations.”</p><p><h2>Bonus: Unknown or&nbsp;forgotten facts about Bon Jovi</h2></p><p>“You. Me. Last chance!”</p><ul><li>His <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>real name</a> is&nbsp;John Francis Bongiovi Jr.</li><li>The first professional recording he&nbsp;did was in&nbsp;1980 for the album, <i>Christmas in&nbsp;the Stars</i>. The record mixed Christmas songs with songs from the <i>Star Wars</i> saga. Bon Jovi’s cousin was the co-owner of&nbsp;the studio in&nbsp;which it&nbsp;was recorded and advised him to&nbsp;perform in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the songs.</li><li>He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>won</a> a&nbsp;Golden Globe in&nbsp;1991 for “Best Original Song” for the song, “Blaze of&nbsp;Glory,” which was part of&nbsp;the film, <i>Young Guns II</i>. He&nbsp;was also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>nominated</a> for an&nbsp;Oscar that same year, but Madonna took the statuette for the song, “Sooner or&nbsp;Later”<i> </i>from the film, <i>Dick Tracy.</i></li><li>He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>suffers </a>from eye hypersensitivity. The singer is&nbsp;very sensitive to&nbsp;light, and that’s the reason why he&nbsp;usually wears sunglasses.</li><li>He&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;admirer of&nbsp;Frank <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Sinatra</a>, who was also born in&nbsp;New Jersey. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>used</a> to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;the singer in&nbsp;his dressing room every time he&nbsp;performed. One of&nbsp;Bon Jovi’s most famous songs, “It’s My&nbsp;Life,” even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mentions</a> Sinatra. In&nbsp;it, it&nbsp;says, “Like Frankie said, I&nbsp;did it&nbsp;my&nbsp;way,” alluding to&nbsp;the song, “My&nbsp;Way,” by&nbsp;Sinatra.</li></ul><p>Did you know about this respectable side of&nbsp;Bon Jovi?

He decided that the Britain’s Got Talent stage was the perfect place. He feels like the show is “contrived” and “manipulative” and wanted to prove a point by challenging judge <a href=#>Simon Cowell</a>.</strong></p><p>Brodkin typically performs his stunts dressed as his alter ego, Lee Nelson. He most famously jumped on the stage at a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye West concert</a> in 2015, and interrupted a press conference of former FIFA president Sepp Blatter that same year. Brodkin came up with a formula to try and prank the BGT judges in 2016. He filmed the whole experience for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a documentary</a> that aired in 2017.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-simon-brodkin-pulls-off-the-rapping-rabbi-prank-on-bgt><strong>Simon Brodkin</strong> Pulls Off the Rapping Rabbi Prank on ‘BGT’</h2><p>Brodkin explained in the documentary that he feels like BGT contestants don’t actually need to have talent to get on the show. He saw that most acts that go through to the next round have a <a href=#>sob story</a>. Brodkin knew that he had to make his act unexpected and be patriotic. His mission was to get into the BGT auditions and see how long he could last.</p><p>Brodkin decided to do a rapping act dressed as an Orthodox Jew named Steven Goldblatt, AKA The Rapping Rabbi. He got his story down pat about how he likes to listen in secret to Eminem and Dr. Dre. Brodkin auditioned for the producers as Steven, and got a call 10 days later to send them a video of another rap. He wrote a second rap about loving Britain and heard back from the producers two weeks after.</p><p>He was asked to fill out a questionnaire where he created his own sob story about his mom passing away and caring for his father. A few days later, he was invited to audition in front of the judges. He decided to perform his song about Britain for his big audition. Simon Cowell said that it could be the new National Anthem.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Amanda Holden called the performance “brilliant.” Alesha Dixon loved that the song made references to all of the judges. David Walliams pretty much proved Brodkin’s whole point when he called the act “unexpected.” Steven got four “yes” votes from the judges. He was wrapping up his final interview of the day when one of the executive producers figured out his real identity. After that, his BGT audition was basically null and void. His stunt even made the newspapers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-has-he-been-up-to-since-his-audition>What Has He Been Up to Since His Audition?</h2><p>In 2017, Brodkin interrupted Prime Minister&nbsp;Theresa May’s speech <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">at a press conference.</a> He handed her a&nbsp;P45&nbsp;form and told her that Boris Johnson asked him to deliver it. After going viral with his Lee Nelson persona, Brodkin decided to take a bit of a step back from the character.</p><p>“I’d wanted to do stand-up as myself for a while but never had the time with back-to-back Lee tours,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he said</a> in 2019. “There’s things I can say and areas that I can get into that I just couldn’t as Lee. And his tracksuit no longer fitted.”</p><p>He has since continued his career as a standup comedian. Brodkin debuted a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>brand-new sold out standup show</a> in August 2019 in Edinburgh. He also revealed that he would be going on his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>first ever stand-up tour</a> as himself around the U.K. In March 2020, Brodkin announced that his tour <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>had been postponed</a> due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>contracted the virus</a> that same month and has since made a full recovery.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>“I’m excited, it feels liberating. Like the comedy equivalent of coming out,” he said about performing as himself. “Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely loved playing Lee – the things you can get away with as a character that might have got me knocked out as myself. But I’m now having a lot of fun as myself. Still a clown, just a different one.”</p><p>Brodkin posted on Instagram that his new <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Troublemaker tour</a> is set to kick off this fall. He continues to upload skits and comedy videos over on his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube channel.</a> In the midst of the pandemic, Brodkin gathered 30 of his stand-up comedian friends over Zoom to record a song for the NHS. The song was just released and Brodkin is encouraging his followers to download, donate, and share it.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GettyImages-1017313438.jpg alt="Maddie Poppe, Caleb Lee Hutchinson Perform Casual Concert At Shane Dawson’s House" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Britain's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>simon cowell</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGYrWWYlr2xsc2em2asn2LBqbGMq5ipqJmjtG6%2BwJuZomWnnbxuss6oo56cXai2rrvNZpqor5WhuW67zWaZoKxf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-9-year-old-golden-buzzer-recipient-celine-tam-up-to-in-2021.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is 9 Year-Old Golden Buzzer Recipient Celine Tam Up to in 2021?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./we-ranked-10-of-the-most-toxic-movie-relationships-811374.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>We Ranked 10 of the Most Toxic Movie Relationships</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

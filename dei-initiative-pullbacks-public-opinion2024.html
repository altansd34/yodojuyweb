And in recent months, many large brands have done just that.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Major tech companies like Google and Meta began <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>cutting</a> budgets for diverse employee resources groups and laying off staff in DEI-related roles late last year. More of their Silicon Valley peers <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>followed suit</a> in early 2024. Some companies have even gone so far as to <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>eliminate</a> DEI programs and goals in their entirety.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">As this wave of anti-DEI sentiment sweeps corporate America, new Morning Consult data offers insight into how various groups are reacting — or not. We found that awareness of and support for the trend largely follows generational, partisan and identity-based lines, once again spotlighting the increasingly factionalized nature of the American consumer cohort.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Corporate decisions to limit DEI efforts aren’t reaching the general public en masse</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Less than 2 in 5 (38%) U.S. adults said they have seen, read or heard something about companies rolling back DEI initiatives, suggesting that this news has yet to permeate the public consciousness in a broadly meaningful way.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Still, awareness is notably higher among men (47%) and Republicans (42%), a skew that <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>closely aligns</a> with the demographics of those who consider themselves fans of right-leaning voices and outlets, like Tucker Carlson and Fox News, that <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>frequently espouse</a> negative views on DEI.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In contrast, a smaller share of women (29%) reported having heard about the trend — an outcome that can be explained, in part, by their generally <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>lower levels</a> of news consumption. But Morning Consult Intelligence data reveals that another media usage habit might also be playing a role.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Relative to the average U.S. adult, women are much less likely to use the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), where anti-DEI content has <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>flourished</a> since billionaire Elon Musk’s takeover in late 2022. (Musk regularly <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>expresses opposition</a> to DEI programs in posts on his personal account, too.)&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The disparate levels of awareness about recent DEI rollbacks speak to the siloing influence of media diets today. With so many sources for news and analysis — especially sources that are algorithmically-informed — it’s easier than ever to exist in an echo chamber of one’s own design (at least online). Accordingly, brands should no longer assume that the average consumer has been exposed to a certain issue or message.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Support for rolling back DEI programs diverges along demographic lines</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Consumers’ views on DEI walkbacks mirror their overall awareness of it: Sizable shares of men, Republicans and older adults are in favor of companies doing things like decreasing the influence of DEI programs or ending them entirely. At the same time, women, Democrats, younger adults and people of color largely oppose these actions.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The outsized support of rollback efforts by men and Republicans may be a function of fear, as these two groups are among the most likely to say that DEI programs “mostly hurt” people like them. They are also among the <i>least</i> likely to believe that brands are genuine in their efforts to help minority groups through DEI initiatives. What’s more, there’s a <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>strong connection</a> between brands promoting diversity and inclusion and being perceived as “woke,” which previous Morning Consult research found is a descriptor that male and right-leaning consumers broadly view as negative.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">This omnipresent feeling of “being under attack” by certain societal institutions or norms colors other parts of life for both subsets of consumers, too. It’s a sentiment that is partly responsible for lots of recent cultural trends, like a rise in popularity of “<a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>trad</a>” content online or the <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>widening ideology gap</a> between genders.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">That said, it’s important to note that the share of all U.S. adults who support companies walking back DEI commitments is generally lower than the share who oppose this kind of action — meaning, at the highest level, Americans are in favor of companies continuing existing DEI programs.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Most Americans see value in DEI programs&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Nearly 3 in 5 (58%) U.S. adults said that DEI initiatives are either “very” or “somewhat” important to the success of most businesses, and this share was even higher (63%) among those who are currently employed full-time.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">This is consistent with data featured in Morning Consult’s <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>recent report</a> on consumer appetite for corporate engagement amid the 2024 election cycle, which found that approximately 2 in 3 (66%) employed U.S. adults believe the presence of DEI programs positively impacts their organization’s culture.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Another finding consistent with this research? Consumers are more likely to take notice of — and place value on — internal DEI efforts over external ones. For example, clear majorities of U.S. adults said recruiting (57%) and promoting (55%) employees from minority groups is effective at achieving workplace equality, while less than half (47%) said the same about companies supporting inclusion through product lines, such as selling LGBTQ+ Pride or Black History Month merchandise.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>The future of corporate DEI programs&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Brands that have walked back on existing DEI commitments have yet to face any major consumer reactions — bad or good. Morning Consult data shows that this will likely continue to be the case for the immediate future: Just 21% of U.S. adults said they have boycotted a brand after learning it reversed course on any stated DEI efforts, and an equally low share (20%) said the same about buycotting, which is when consumers intentionally purchase from a brand because of its political, ethical or social stances.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">And while threats or opportunities tied to DEI rollbacks are minimal, brands that engage in them still risk sacrificing long-term favorability among the general public to bend toward the short-term demands of a smaller few — especially considering that the topic has proven so enduring.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX5myqnnIp6CtoZGptrexjKmspaSSlrCsv4yprJukmZh6sLzIp6CopmJlf3U%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fda-hold-public-hearing-gaming-drug-industry.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>FDA to Hold Public Hearing on 'Gaming' in Drug Industry</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./clint-eastwood-reveals-his-secret-to-staying-healthy-in-his-nineties-and-keeping-active-at-work-806656.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Clint Eastwood Reveals His Secret to Staying Healthy in His Nineties and Keeping Active at Work</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

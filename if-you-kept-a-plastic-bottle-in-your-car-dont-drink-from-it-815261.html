Here’s what to&nbsp;watch out for before leaving your car.</p><p>Number one is&nbsp;aerosol cans: hairspray, deodorant, spray paint, household cleaner, and sorts. On&nbsp;the back of&nbsp;these cans, you might notice a&nbsp;storage temperature recommendation. Well, stick to&nbsp;that. Here’s what can happen. Since these cans are pressurized, they become more sensitive to&nbsp;temperature. What’s inside the aerosol may expand, and this may result in&nbsp;a&nbsp;crack. And then, the can can blow&nbsp;up. Temperatures above 120 degrees Fahrenheit are already alarming. And it&nbsp;can easily get as&nbsp;hot as&nbsp;that in&nbsp;your car on&nbsp;a&nbsp;warm summer day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/217/691/6b7af95dd7bce5e0e23f002691.png><p>Researchers from the USA have figured out how long it&nbsp;takes a&nbsp;car to&nbsp;turn into a&nbsp;“sweat factory” on&nbsp;a&nbsp;hot day. Within 1&nbsp;hour, the insides of&nbsp;a&nbsp;car parked in&nbsp;the sun reaches 95&nbsp;degrees Fahrenheit or&nbsp;hotter, with an&nbsp;average of&nbsp;116 degrees Fahrenheit. So, if&nbsp;you want your car in&nbsp;one piece and running, take aerosol cans with you.</p><p>The second item is&nbsp;sunscreen. Sunscreen is&nbsp;vital for your skin since it&nbsp;decreases the risk of&nbsp;skin complications and prevents skin aging caused by&nbsp;the sun. This includes wrinkles, sagging, and age spots. But when you leave sunscreen in&nbsp;your car, it&nbsp;gets exposed to&nbsp;high temperatures, and it&nbsp;can ultimately shorten its shelf life. If&nbsp;you end up&nbsp;finding a&nbsp;spoilt sunscreen, you might notice a&nbsp;funny smell when you open the cap. Plus, the heat might cause the cap to&nbsp;open, and the sticky substance will get all over the car. The same rule applies to&nbsp;lipsticks and other cosmetics as&nbsp;well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/cb9/7e6/11e4425bd68fba24a8b5eac915.png><p>The next one is&nbsp;plastic bottles. There are two reasons why you shouldn’t leave them inside your car. Firstly, a&nbsp;plastic water bottle can act as&nbsp;a&nbsp;lens, magnifying the sun’s rays and starting a&nbsp;fire. A&nbsp;Fire Department in&nbsp;Oklahoma conducted an&nbsp;experiment and confirmed that the danger of&nbsp;fire was real. David Richardson from that department says that it&nbsp;can happen if&nbsp;the beam of&nbsp;light is&nbsp;focused enough. The second reason is&nbsp;related to&nbsp;your health. Many plastic bottles contain bisphenol, a&nbsp;potentially toxic compound. The BPA levels can increase at&nbsp;high temperatures, and that can be&nbsp;harmful to&nbsp;your body. There’s a&nbsp;chance that this chemical can get into your drink after you leave the bottle inside the vehicle.</p><p>Oh, and batteries! They can lose their capacity to&nbsp;work at&nbsp;full power when they are left abandoned in&nbsp;the car. You can buy a&nbsp;new pair and fix this problem, but it&nbsp;won’t be&nbsp;as&nbsp;easy to&nbsp;solve the problem of&nbsp;leakage or&nbsp;a&nbsp;rupture. It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;bad for your health because battery acid is&nbsp;dangerous when inhaled and highly corrosive. The reason for leakage is&nbsp;again related to&nbsp;high temperatures. Battery manufacturers recommend keeping their products at&nbsp;room temperature.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/720/6f2/9511e357e695bb6efd20871a69.png><p>This fact is&nbsp;partially related to&nbsp;batteries: it’s about electronics. Have you ever realized how hot your phone can get when it’s exposed to&nbsp;the sun? You’re driving and, let’s say, looking at&nbsp;the GPS on&nbsp;your phone. Even in&nbsp;this situation, your phone can heat&nbsp;up. What will happen to&nbsp;it&nbsp;after hours of&nbsp;sun exposure? Phone companies are strongly against customers leaving their devices in&nbsp;vehicles because they might shut down, get damaged, or&nbsp;— you know, boom!</p><p>Personal belongings are another priority on&nbsp;the list. A&nbsp;<a href=# title=wallet data-link=tag>wallet</a> or&nbsp;a&nbsp;handbag may come to&nbsp;one’s mind first. Yet, a&nbsp;<a href=# title=passport data-link=tag>passport</a> or&nbsp;even some change you leave near the passenger seat is&nbsp;sometimes enough to&nbsp;attract a&nbsp;thief. Better to&nbsp;keep such stuff out of&nbsp;sight&nbsp;— for example, by&nbsp;storing it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the trunk instead of&nbsp;leaving it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the backseat.</p><p>Number 7&nbsp;is also related to&nbsp;theft. Life can be&nbsp;too hectic sometimes, and it’s understandable if&nbsp;you can’t clean your car frequently. But leaving garbage in&nbsp;the car is&nbsp;another mistake. Thieves tend to&nbsp;search for messy-looking cars. They think that the owner doesn’t use such a&nbsp;vehicle frequently.</p><p>How about <a href=# title=plants data-link=tag>plants</a>? I&nbsp;know it&nbsp;isn’t that common to&nbsp;keep plants in&nbsp;the car on&nbsp;a&nbsp;daily basis, but sometimes you need to&nbsp;move them. The heat inside the vehicle can easily dehydrate the poor thing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/576/54d/8a800b515cb951c90e812180cd.png><p>Medications are another thing you shouldn’t keep in&nbsp;the car for too long. The constantly changing temperatures inside the vehicle can decrease the effectiveness of&nbsp;your pills. Authorities recommend keeping most medications at&nbsp;59&nbsp;to&nbsp;77&nbsp;degrees Fahrenheit in&nbsp;a&nbsp;cool and dry place.</p><p>Important documents that contain your personal data shouldn’t be&nbsp;left in&nbsp;the vehicle either. Some examples of&nbsp;such documents are tax forms, financial statements, and school transcripts. A&nbsp;thief could commit fraud or&nbsp;identity theft using this valuable information.</p><p>...And there’s also food and drinks. Experts recommend not leaving groceries or&nbsp;leftovers in&nbsp;a&nbsp;warm car for more than two hours&nbsp;— or&nbsp;only an&nbsp;hour when it’s over 90&nbsp;degrees Fahrenheit. The same rule applies in&nbsp;the winter too.</p><p>Canned foods, for example, have a&nbsp;high risk of&nbsp;going bad. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;can of&nbsp;sweet peas, let’s say, gets frozen in&nbsp;the car, the effect will be&nbsp;similar to&nbsp;what would happen to&nbsp;a&nbsp;soda. Let it&nbsp;thaw in&nbsp;the refrigerator instead of&nbsp;leaving it&nbsp;at&nbsp;room temperature. If&nbsp;the product doesn’t look or&nbsp;smell normal, throw it&nbsp;away in&nbsp;a&nbsp;place where not even an&nbsp;animal can find&nbsp;it. Don’t try to&nbsp;taste&nbsp;it; just trust your other senses. If&nbsp;the item seems rusted or&nbsp;there are some cracks in&nbsp;the can, it&nbsp;should end up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the trash too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4fe/f54/8492b5506abdda232a7c44f745.png><p>Eggs are another example. Normally, eggs shouldn’t be&nbsp;frozen. But let’s suppose you forgot one grocery bag in&nbsp;the trunk of&nbsp;the car, and the weather was so&nbsp;cold at&nbsp;night that the eggs got frozen. Keep the eggs in&nbsp;the refrigerator before use. They should be&nbsp;hard-cooked&nbsp;— it’s your only option. You see, freezing causes the yolk to&nbsp;become thick and syrup-like. It&nbsp;loses that natural flow and doesn’t mix well with other ingredients.</p><p>You shouldn’t leave your pets alone in&nbsp;the car&nbsp;— obviously. And not just because of&nbsp;a&nbsp;potential rise in&nbsp;temperature! They will feel uncomfortable without you, their best friend, accompanying them. In&nbsp;their frustration, they might do&nbsp;something to&nbsp;get noticed, which can&nbsp;be, for example, ruining the interior of&nbsp;the vehicle.</p><p>Now let’s return to&nbsp;the winter season again. If&nbsp;possible, keep the gas tank of&nbsp;your car over half full. This can prevent the petrol lines from freezing. It&nbsp;also makes it&nbsp;easier to&nbsp;start the engine and hit the road in&nbsp;the morning. While keeping an&nbsp;eye on&nbsp;the fuel bar, it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good idea to&nbsp;glance at&nbsp;the tire pressure too. The cold can result in&nbsp;tire pressure drops.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d4c/568/eb490d516d8527bf6456665abc.png><p>Not only high but also low temperatures can damage some items. A&nbsp;good example is&nbsp;paint cans. They should be&nbsp;quickly taken out of&nbsp;the vehicle in&nbsp;the winter. The ingredients in&nbsp;the paint can experience expansion, separation, and clumping due to&nbsp;the cold. In&nbsp;other words, you won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;use this paint anymore.</p><p>Weather also affects wooden musical instruments, like violins or&nbsp;guitars. Changes in&nbsp;temperature and humidity can cause wooden instruments to&nbsp;warp, crack, or&nbsp;split.</p><p>Glasses get affected by&nbsp;fluctuating temperatures too. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;hot car, plastic frames can bend. Or&nbsp;plastic can become brittle when it’s very cold. This makes glasses more prone to&nbsp;breaking.</p><p>Don’t leave house keys and garage door openers inside the car. This is&nbsp;an&nbsp;everyday practice for many people, but it’s risky. They can get into the wrong hands.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/817/c16/50b22c5070a20505541b16a1b2.png><p>To&nbsp;listen to&nbsp;music, most people connect their phones to&nbsp;the car or&nbsp;listen to&nbsp;the radio. CDs are getting less and less used these days. But don’t leave them in&nbsp;the car anyway. They might get warped, and you won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;use them anymore. Can you think of&nbsp;any other item you shouldn’t leave in&nbsp;the car?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLanediorGajlaXBbq2MqaOaq6SesG6uzq2rpZ1dnrtuxc6uqWabkad6pbvNrWSdqpmjuG6y0aikZqGkYoVygZFvaGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./anime-rise-dragonball-z-crunchyroll.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Inside Animes Rise to the Top of American Pop Culture</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-money-does-tommy-shaw-make-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Money Does Tommy Shaw Make?

This verified the import of poor diesel by Matrix.</p><p class=align-left>According to Dangote, the test was conducted utilizing the ASTM D4294 technique using an Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (ED-XRF) Spectro Photometer.</p>“Our quality is about 600 to 650 ppm and is one of the best in terms of quality at that time when we started. But as of today, we’re at 87 ppm,” he said.“The sample from TotalEnergies’s diesel showed 1,829ppm sulphur concentration.

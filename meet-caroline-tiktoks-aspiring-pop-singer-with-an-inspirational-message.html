She has released multiple positive anthems and stays true to herself and her story on her social media platforms. Not only is Caroline an aspiring singer, she also uses her platforms to raise awareness on the <a href=#>eating disorder recovery</a> process.</strong></p><p>Caroline shared on TikTok that she developed an eating disorder that then lead to mast cell activation syndrome, essentially making her allergic to all foods. She is now slowly recovering and sharing the journey with her followers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Caroline Got Her Start in Music</h2><p>Caroline currently has 503,100 followers on TikTok and is using her platform to share her music and personal journey. She is an aspiring pop singer who has released numerous tunes on <a href=#>Spotify</a> and is known for singing on live stream.</p><p>“I joined [TikTok] the app, well mainly, I remember I was doing an all day <a href=#>Instagram</a> live and then everybody was talking about the TikTok trends and the dances and were telling me to join so then I kind of just thought it would be fun,” said Caroline. “Then I got a little addicted.”</p><p>She began writing music at 12-years-old and has been obsessed ever since. Since she began writing, she has looked for anyway to record and release her songs. Caroline enjoys releasing her music independently because she gets the ultimate say on the meaning behind her songs. Her newest song “Favorite Person in the World” holds a positive vibe, much like her other releases.</p><p>“It was mainly just about like telling somebody in your life how much you love them and how fortunate we are for them because a lot of times we don’t do that,” she said.</p><p>Even though a lot of her music holds a positive meaning, not all of her songs are happy. Caroline writes music based off the state of mind she’s in. She’s honest in the fact that, although she tries to produce positive songs, she’s not always in a positive mindset.</p><p>“Even if it’s a sad song hopefully people will feel like they’re not alone and like they’re not the only person going through it,” said Caroline. “If it’s happy they’ll just be in a good mood and able to dance or have fun.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-caroline-hopes-to-grow-with-original-songs>Caroline Hopes to Grow with Original Songs</h2><p>Caroline’s releases are mostly inspired from the music of Madonna. On Instagram and TikTok, she can often be seen singing her own music in addition to covers. Unfortunately, we might not see her on <a href=# class=broken_link>America’s Got Talent</a> or <a href=#>American Idol</a> anytime soon.</p><p>“I don’t know I feel like it’s hard because you can’t do original songs, but if you could do original songs I would love that,” said Caroline. “I enjoy doing them [covers] but originals are mainly where my heart lies.”</p><p>If another show like <a href=#>Songland</a> were to pop up to give songwriters the opportunity to play their original music, it would be a no-brainer for her. On top of singing, Caroline also dances. She began dancing after admiring people who sing and dance together in a performance.</p><p>“I always thought it always made the performance more interesting so it [learning to dance] mainly started from that,” said Caroline. “Then I actually like loved ballet so much, which isn’t like-I mean I guess you could sing and do ballet at the same time if you wanted to.”</p><p>When Caroline isn’t posting videos about her eating disorder recovery journey, she’s either singing or <a href=#>dancing</a>. This aspiring singer tries to uplift her followers through everything she posts. She wants her social media accounts to provide relaxing atmosphere for her fans. There’s so many negative things happening in the world, so she hopes her account is a breath of fresh air.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blake-and-Gwen.jpeg alt="Blake Shelton to Release His Wedding Song for Gwen Stefani at Midnight" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWTlr%2BwuMinnGasmaDBsLfSZpisqJmntq%2BzjKmmqWWjnruosdFmrqKsmGKur3nIp6qpoaKWwaq7zZqjZqWVqMCis8Ro</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./meet-kevin-hawkins-the-singer-gwen-stefani-used-her-block-and-steal-for.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Kevin Hawkins, The Singer Gwen Stefani Used Her Block and Steal For</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./meet-aidan-bryant-the-self-taught-aerialist-from-americas-got-talent.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Aidan Bryant, The Self-Taught Aerialist From 'Americas Got Talent'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

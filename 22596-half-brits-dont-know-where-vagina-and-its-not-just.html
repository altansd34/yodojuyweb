We accepted misspelled but obviously correct answers, and even euphemistic or descriptive responses when appropriate (e.g. ‘wee hole’ for urethra’ or ‘lips’ for ‘labia’).</p><p>Even so, half of Britons could not identify or describe the function of the urethra (58%), labia (47%) or vagina (52%).</p><p>Breaking those results down by gender, we find that six in ten men (59%) and half of women (45%) could not even label the vagina. Slightly more didn’t know what the urethra was (61% of men and 55% of women). Around half of both genders failed to label the labia (52% of men and 43% of women).</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/femalegenitalia.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Diagram: Getty</p><p>The only part of the female genitalia which the majority of both genders labelled correctly was the clitoris, identified correctly by two thirds of men and women (71% of women, 69% of men).</p><p>However, that leaves a third of both women and men who did not know what the clitoris was (29% women, 31% men).</p><p><strong>Half of women didn’t realise their vagina was self-cleaning</strong></p><p>As well as asking Britons to identify body parts, we also surveyed women about their understanding of their own bodies. We discovered a worrying lack of knowledge among women about how their genitalia works.</p><p>For instance, the vagina contains a large amount of bacteria, but the good kind: it keeps the area healthy. Washing inside the vagina - even just with water - damages the natural balance of bacteria and is highly likely to lead to infections.</p><p>However, half of women (46%) we surveyed did not know that you shouldn’t wash the inside of your vagina. A third (33%) think it should be washed on a daily basis; one in six (14%) say with water and soap, and one in five (19%) with water only. One in fifty (2%) think it should be washed with water after sex, rising to 7% of those aged from 18 to 24 .</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Victoria20vagina20washing-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>One in ten (10%) did not know the answer, or chose ‘none of these’ - making a total of 46% of women who were unable to identify the correct method to keep the female genitals clean.</p><p>Just over half (54%) correctly said that the best method is not to wash inside at all.</p><p><strong>Do you need to take out a tampon to urinate?</strong></p><p>YouGov also asked a more practical question to hone in on people’s understanding of the female anatomy: whether it’s necessary to take out a tampon to urinate.</p><p>Respondents were asked which statement they thought was true in regards to whether a tampon: “used to soak up blood during a period” and “interferes with urination”.</p><p>Six in ten men (57%) and eight in ten women (82%) correctly identified that a tampon does not interfere with how someone urinates – because the blood comes from a different hole.</p><p>However, a total of one in five women (18%) agreed with statements saying the tampon would need to be replaced, thought none of the given statements were true, or said they did not know. This total rises to 43% of men.</p><p>Photo: Getty</p><p><strong>See the full results <a href=#>here</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtktaaty62faJmiqbakuMSsZmtqZW6DbrTApZ1mmqKewbR5w6ilrWWbo7y4edahnKudXauuqLXNmmSappRitrW%2FjKemrWWaqsC1</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-money-does-sam-mendes-make-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Money Does Sam Mendes Make?

After being reported missing and allegedly threatening suicide, his wife of four years, Janet Von Schmeling, has filed for divorce.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-drake-bell-s-wife-files-for-divorce>Drake Bell’s Wife Files For Divorce</h2><p>Bell has been a household name since the early 2000s, when he starred in Drake & Josh. Unfortunately, as he’s gotten older, he’s faced some personal struggles. His recent disappearance and divorce filing have brought those struggles to the forefront. With a one-year-old son involved and mental health concerns, the situation is complicated.</p><p>Recently, Bell was reported <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">missing</a> by his family after he allegedly threatened suicide in response to child custody issues with his wife, Janet Von Schmeling. Fortunately, he was found safe and sound, and deputies took action to ensure he received a mental health evaluation.</p><p>Shortly after this incident, Von Schmeling filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. She’s seeking primary legal and physical custody of their one-year-old son, Wyatt, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">spousal support</a>. The couple had been married for four years but separated in September 2022.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Bell has faced personal struggles. In 2014, he filed for bankruptcy, citing debts of over $581,000. He’s also been arrested for DUI and faced legal trouble for not paying taxes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Drake Bell Has Found Success Despite The Recent Struggles</h2><p>Despite the recent struggles, Bell has also had some positive moments in his personal life. In 2019, he announced that he had married Von Schmeling and that they were expecting a child. Wyatt was born in 2021.</p><p>Bell has also continued to pursue his music career, releasing several albums and touring regularly. In recent years, he’s focused on a more Latin-inspired sound and has collaborated with artists such as Farruko and Ozuna.</p><p>As Bell navigates these personal struggles, it’s clear that mental health is a priority. In an interview, he spoke candidly about his struggles with depression and anxiety and the importance of seeking help. It’s a message that’s important for anyone who may be going through a difficult time.</p><p>In conclusion, Bell’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">personal life</a> has been marked by both ups and downs. While he’s faced some serious struggles, he’s also had positive moments and continues to pursue his passions. As he moves forward, let’s hope that he’s able to prioritize his mental health and find happiness in his personal life.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Original_MaskedSinger_Judges_S8_Michael-Becker_FOX-220x147.jpg alt="‘The Masked Singer’ Fans Left Disappointed After The Show Aired Another Recap Episode" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w6uYpJ1dl7KtuNJmrqKelWK2tHnFoqOippdis7C%2BjJ2gr6eimLJurcWtnKtlpJ2ybq3CraarZaeau7V5zKKqrKGenHqiedaenKRlkpqzsL7EaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1294687-evan-peters-bio-age-height-net-worth-girlfriend-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Evan Peters bio: age, height, net worth, girlfriend</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1213158-different-types-birds-nigeria-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Different types of birds in Nigeria</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

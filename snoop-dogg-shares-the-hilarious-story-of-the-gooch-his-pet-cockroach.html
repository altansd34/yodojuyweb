The Long Beach, California native said that he found the roach in his apartment when he first moved in and that he was initially trying to kill it. However, the cockroach was very resilient, and Snoop eventually gave up and decided to keep it as a pet.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-snoop-dogg-had-a-pet-cockroach-for-six-months>Snoop Dogg Had a Pet Cockroach For Six Months</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Snoop Dogg</a> said that he named the cockroach The Gooch because it was “the ugliest roach I ever seen.” He also said that the cockroach “just kept getting bigger and bigger” under his care. At its biggest, Gooch was about the size of a dollar bill.</p><p>Snoop said that he used to leave food out for The Gooch and that the cockroach would sometimes crawl on him while he was sleeping. He also said that he never got sick from having The Gooch as a pet.</p><p>Snoop’s story about The Gooch has gone viral, and it has been met with mixed reactions. Some people find it to be hilarious, while others find it to be disgusting. However, there is no denying that Snoop Dogg is a unique individual, and his story about The Gooch is just one more example of his quirkiness.</p><p>In addition to his pet cockroach, Snoop Dogg is also a well-known <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">animal</a> lover. He has a long history of supporting animal rights causes, and he has even started his own line of pet products called Snoop Doggie Doggs.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Snoop Dogg Joins a $20 Million Funding Round for Web3 Music Platform, Sound</h2><p>Sound is a Web3 music platform that aims to help artists by removing intermediaries and connecting them directly to fans through blockchain. Artists can mint their songs on-chain as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and sell them directly to their fans.</p><p>Snoop Dogg’s investment in Sound is a sign of his belief in the potential of Web3 to revolutionize the music industry. He has said that he believes that artists deserve to have higher pay for their work, and that Web3 can help to achieve this.</p><p>Sound is still in its early stages, but it has already generated $5.5 million for creators through direct music sales as NFTs. The platform will be open to the public soon, and it could have a major impact on the music industry.</p><p>It will be interesting to see how Snoop Dogg’s investment in Sound plays out. If Sound is successful, it could help to usher in a new era of music distribution that gives artists more control over their work and their earnings.</p><p>In addition to his investment in Sound, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Snoop Dogg</a> has also been vocal about his support for Web3 in general. With a firm belief in the transformative power of Web3 to “change the world,” he takes an active role in encouraging other artists to join.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_NikkiBella_ArtemChigvinstev_GMA-220x147.jpg alt="Nikki Garcia Wants Husband, Artem Chigvintsev To Be Partnered With Ariana Madix For ‘DWTS’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qemqKhdmbyos4ysn5qqlah6tbTEZp%2BipJGntrDB0maqraeirnqwsoytn55ll6S8pLSMoaCsZaCawW6vzpyiq6eRmLVw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./super-bowl.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Super Bowl News and Analysis</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1425035-remembering-dora-akunyili-5-facts-widely-loved-nigerian-pharmacist-67th-posthumous-birthday-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Remembering Dora Akunyili: 5 Facts about Widely-Loved Nigerian Pharmacist on her 67th Posthumous Bir</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

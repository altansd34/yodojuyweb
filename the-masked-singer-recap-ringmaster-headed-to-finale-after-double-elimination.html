Armadillo was unmasked as Dog the Bounty Hunter, while Miss Teddy was revealed to be Jennifer Holliday.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ringmaster-heads-to-the-masked-singer-finale>Ringmaster Heads to ‘The Masked Singer’ Finale</h2><p>Only one contestant from Wednesday’s show could make it to the Season 7 finale. That turned out to be Ringmaster, who delivered a powerhouse performance of “I Will Always Love You.” Jenny McCarthy called it “the most beautiful, epic performance ever,” promising to shave her head if Ringmaster doesn’t win.</p><p>Ringmaster was touched by the judges’ positive reaction, explaining that music is their first love. The judges suspected this could mean they do something else for a living, which is why their voice might be harder to pin down.</p><p>Guesses from the judges included Sarah Hyland from Modern Family, as well as country stars such as Kacey Musgraves and Maren Morris. We can’t wait to hear Ringmaster <a href=#>go up against Firefly</a> (and the last, to-be-determined finalist) in the finale.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-miss-teddy-unmasked-as-jennifer-holliday>Miss Teddy Unmasked as Jennifer Holliday</h3><p>Miss Teddy kicked off the show with an iconic performance of “Mercy” by Duffy that had all five judges (including guest judge Leslie Jordan) standing on the table. Nicole Scherzinger described her as “one of a kind,” and Jordan said he was “gobsmacked.”</p><p>Sadly, Miss Teddy was one of the contestants eliminated at the end of the night. It’s unfortunate that she had to compete in the same group as Ringmaster, because they’re two of the strongest singers this season, and they both deserved a finale spot.</p><p>Guesses from the judges included Yolanda Adams and Gloria Gaynor. However, only Scherzinger and Jordan were correct in guessing that Miss Teddy was legendary Dreamgirls star Jennifer Holliday. The singer said her fans have been guessing that she’s on the show for several seasons, so she figured she should actually participate.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Armadillo Revealed to Be Dog the Bounty Hunter</h3><p>Armadillo had the weakest performance vocally this week, but it’s hard to compete with Ringmaster and Miss Teddy. Still, he brought the emotion by singing “Amazing Grace” and dedicating it to his mother. The judges were touched, especially Scherzinger, who was brought to tears.</p><p>Armadillo got choked up himself as he shared that it was his mother’s favorite song. Unfortunately, he didn’t earn enough votes to go to the finale, so he had to be unmasked. Guesses from the judges included Gary Busey and Stone Cold Steve Austin.</p><p>However, only McCarthy and Scherzinger correctly guessed that it was Dog the Bounty Hunter. He shared that he wasn’t used to singing for people, joking, “I don’t even sing in the shower.”</p><p>Now that Ringmaster has made it through, there are two Team Good members in the finale. Will Team Cuddly or Team Bad manage to be represented in the final slot? We’ll find out soon, as next week’s show will feature an entirely new group of contestants.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NUP_197274_03215.jpg alt="Meet Broderick Jones, Representing Kansas on ‘American Song Contest’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZqWRqLimsIysoKeflad6s7HCmqdmqpmjtK6t0q2cq2WYmq6lscNmq6hllp67orjEZpifrJWneqW71JujnmWVobautc2aq6KnnmQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rita-ora-wins-the-voice-australia-again-with-singer-tarryn-stokes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rita Ora Wins 'The Voice Australia' Again with Singer Tarryn Stokes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./put-shaving-cream-on-your-broom-and-do-this-brilliant-trick-815091.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Put Shaving Cream on Your Broom And Do THIS (Brilliant Trick)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

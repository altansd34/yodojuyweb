She has since shown off the adorable nursery and all of the gifts that her celebrity friends gave her to celebrate their bundle of joy. RaeLynn’s coach and longtime friend Blake Shelton also sent over a lavish floral arrangement.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-blake-shelton-sent-the-voice-alum-raelynn-an-adorable-baby-gift><strong>Blake Shelton</strong> Sent ‘The Voice’ Alum RaeLynn an Adorable Baby Gift</h2><p>Daisy was gifted a pair of the cutest Ugg slippers from <a href=#>The X Factor</a> alum Kane Brown and a pair of tiny Golden Goose sneakers from Tyler Hubbard of Florida Georgia Line. After establishing a great connection with Shelton on The Voice, it’s no surprise that he also sent over something for this special time in her life. Shelton’s wife Gwen Stefani has impeccable taste so she probably had a hand in picking out the floral arrangement.</p><p>“They’ve been so sweet, and&nbsp;when Daisy was born they sent this huge thing of flowers,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RaeLynn said.</a> “Gwen and Blake have been so sweet about her.”</p><p>RaeLynn and Shelton just collaborated on the track, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Why I Got a Truck,”</a> off of her new Baytown album. RaeLynn knew that she absolutely wanted to do a collaboration with Shelton. Hubbard joined her in the studio to write the country anthem about appreciating trucks. Shelton was immediately on board once she sent it to him. This duet was a long time in the making.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CSTFVesMW04/</p></figure><p>“Me and Blake have been trying to find a song to do together since I&nbsp;have been on&nbsp;The&nbsp;Voice,&nbsp;and for the last 10 years, we have been like, ‘What are we going to do? What are we going to do?'” she said. “We could not do a love song. That would be weird, because he is like my freaking dad slash uncle, and so we were just always bouncing songs back and forth to each other.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-pair-have-a-decade-long-friendship>The Pair Have a Decade-Long Friendship</h2><p>RaeLynn was just 17 years old when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she auditioned</a> for The Voice. Shelton smiled the second he heard her authentic country sound. Once he turned his chair, RaeLynn spoke about how much of an inspiration his now ex-wife <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Miranda Lambert</a> was to her. From then on, RaeLynn’s bond with Shelton was formed.</p><p>“I honestly think the bond that we have is just, he met me at a very young age and he saw my ability to song-write, and I remember when I&nbsp;first showed him one of my songs,” she shared. “I showed him&nbsp;‘Boyfriend,’&nbsp;and he was like, ‘You wrote this?’&nbsp;and I was like, ‘Yeah,’&nbsp;and&nbsp;that was one of the first times that I met him, when I&nbsp;was on&nbsp;The&nbsp;Voice, and he was just so sweet and I don’t know, every once in a while, you just meet somebody that you are like, ‘This person is going to be in my life for the rest of my life,’&nbsp;and&nbsp;I just know that I am going to know that person.”</p><p>Even before giving birth, RaeLynn referred to Shelton as Daisy’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Uncle Blake.”</a> Hopefully, we’ll see more collaborations from the duo in the future.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-681608028.jpg alt="Music Icon Craig David to Judge Simon Cowell’s New Show ‘Walk The Line’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570ZqcpbGeo3q0tMCrnKxlkpavunnGop2tZZanvK5506GcZq6fnrCmecKomJygXaq7pLjEZpmlmZuaerS0xKWrqKZf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./14591-sex-wedding-night.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sex on wedding night becoming less and less common</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./poll-gmail-dominates-email-use.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Poll: Gmail Dominates Email Use Among Millennials, Gen X</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

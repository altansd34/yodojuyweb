This data can come from a variety of sources, such as transactions, customer feedback and social media. By analyzing this data, financial companies can identify patterns and trends that indicate changes in </span><span>consumer behavior</span><span> and preferences.</span></p><p><span>Financial companies can then target areas where their business strategies and customer experiences need to be adjusted to meet evolving consumer expectations.

This can involve conducting surveys and focus groups, observing </span><span>consumer behavior</span><span> and analyzing feedback. By understanding customer pain points, financial companies can pivot their strategies as needed to better address consumer needs.</span></p><h2 id=risk-management><strong><b>Improve risk management</b></strong></h2><p><span>Tracking </span><span>consumer data analytics in financial services </span><span>industries helps companies identify and manage risks more effectively. By analyzing customer data, financial companies can identify patterns of behavior that may indicate increased risk, such as missed payments or high debt levels. This can help them take proactive steps to reduce their risk exposure.</span></p><p><span>For example, tracking consumer confidence data is one way financial services companies can improve risk management. If consumer confidence is low, consumers are more likely to be cautious with spending and investment decisions, which can reduce profits for financial services companies. If consumer confidence is high, consumers are more likely to spend money, invest and accrue debt, which can lead to increased revenue for financial services companies.</span></p><p><span>Interested in seeing how U.S. consumer confidence has shifted over time? </span><a href=#><span>Check out Morning Consult’s U.S. Consumer Confidence Dashboard</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/10/31105636/finance-newsletter-desktop-wide-v1.png alt="Finance industry insights newsletter subscription" width=1800 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><h2 id=competitive-advantage><strong><b>Gain a competitive advantage</b></strong></h2><p><span>As we’ve explored above, analyzing </span><span>consumer data in financial services</span><span> helps companies gain insight into how customers are using their products and services, as well as identify areas of improvement. Because consumer needs are constantly evolving, it’s critical for financial companies to leverage this type of data to gain a competitive advantage.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For example, a financial institution might analyze transaction data to identify customers who frequently use their credit cards to make purchases at restaurants. Based on this data, the company might consider offering these customers a customized credit card with rewards and benefits tailored specifically to their dining habits, helping increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.</span></p><p><span>Another example is the use of demographic data to inform marketing strategies. By analyzing demographic data such as age, gender and location, financial institutions can identify specific customer segments and tailor their marketing efforts accordingly.</span></p><p><span>Ultimately, leveraging consumer data is the most effective way to help companies stay ahead of the competition. </span><a href=#><span>See how financial institutions across the globe are leveraging Morning Consult data to inform their decision-making.</span></a></p><h2 id=predictive-analytics><strong><b>Consumer data paired with predictive analytics can inform business decisions</b></strong></h2><p><span>When paired with <a href=#>predictive analytics</a>, consumer data</span><span> can provide unique insights that can inform business decisions in several ways, including:</span></p><ul><li aria-level=1><b>Customer segmentation</b><span>: By analyzing consumer data using predictive analytics, companies can identify specific customer segments and customize their marketing efforts accordingly.</span></li><li aria-level=1><b>Product development</b><span>: Predictive analytics can also be used to identify market trends and develop new products and services.

Among switchers coming from the Conservatives specifically this balance tips more towards the begrudging group: 55% say they don’t have high hopes but are willing to give Starmer the benefit of the doubt, while 41% are actively optimistic.</p><p data-block-key=98v7>Most voters for other left wing parties are also willing to at least give Labour the benefit of the doubt: 85% of Lib Dem voters and 69% of Green voters.</p><p data-block-key=b8jfb>Most Tory and Reform UK voters expect Labour to fail, but 21-22% from each party are at least willing to begrudge Starmer a chance.</p><h3 id=what-should-labour-prioritise-first data-block-key=8a1hq>What should Labour prioritise first?</h3><p data-block-key=4oq43>Labour have already made pledges for their first 100 days, such as implementing their <a href=#>‘plan to make work pay’</a>, which includes reforms to the living wage, end fire and rehire, and ban zero hours contracts.</p><p data-block-key=af4aj>Few Labour voters think much progress on the UK’s problems can be fixed in the first 100 days (13%), but Starmer will want to be able to point to some major successes within his first year in office. Most, however, say that a great deal or fair amount of the current problems facing the UK can be fixed in the year following the election (58%).</p><p data-block-key=b44id>When we asked how much progress Labour can make towards meeting nine more specific goals, some of which we based directly on the party’s <a href=#>“first steps for change”</a>, in many cases expectations rose. Between 21-41% think at least a fair amount of progress can be made in 100 days, and 51-73% think the same over a one-year timeline</p><p data-block-key=d7r9k>So what would Keir Starmer be best advised to prioritise?</p><p data-block-key=46np7>If we base the answer on those issues which more Labour voters think can be achieved within a shorter timeframe, then the answer is the cost of living and getting the economy growing at a healthy rate.</p><p data-block-key=c38l0>Four in ten Labour voters (41%) think that at least a fair amount of progress can be achieved in improving economic growth within 100 days of the election, as do 39% for bringing down the cost of living.</p><p data-block-key=9opjh>If we expand the timeframe to a year then we can add cutting NHS waiting times and clearing backlogs to that list – around seven in ten Labour voters (70-73%) think at least a fair amount of progress can be made on each of these three issues by 4 July 2025.</p><p data-block-key=bd291>If instead we base the answer on what people themselves say Starmer should prioritise then the NHS comes top.</p><p data-block-key=drd0h>We asked the public to tell us, in their own words, what the one biggest thing they would want Keir Starmer to achieve in the first 100 days of a Labour government. We then used our new AI-powered language model to categorise people’s answers.</p><p data-block-key=fhcdn>Among those who gave an answer, the most common response categories are improving the NHS (20%), reducing immigration (17%) and addressing the cost of living crisis (11%). That is among all Britons, however – if we restrict the results purely to those who are actually attempting to elect a Labour government, we see only two standout answers; the NHS (28%) and cost of living (15%).</p><p data-block-key=cpabp>It is a similar story among voters who are switching to the Labour party at this election – 23% of those who gave a response say the top priority for Starmer’s first 100 days should be the NHS, while the cost of living comes second on 18%.</p><p data-block-key=80zus><b>See the full results</b> <a href=#><b>here</b></a><b> and</b> <a href=#><b>here</b></a></p><p data-block-key=aaspm>What do you think about the possibility of Keir Starmer becoming prime minister, the election campaign in general, and everything else?

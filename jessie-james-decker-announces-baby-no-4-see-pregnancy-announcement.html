Amid the laughter and warmth of her life with husband Eric Decker, she has announced that they are expecting their fourth child. This announcement comes just a few months after the couple’s humorous foray into the world of gin campaigns, where Decker poked fun at her husband’s reluctance to undergo a vasectomy.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jessie-james-decker-announces-fourth-pregnancy>Jessie James Decker Announces Fourth Pregnancy</h2><p>As their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">family</a> continues to grow, the Deckers offer a heartwarming glimpse into their journey of parenthood, partnership, and embracing the unexpected. With a playful video shared on her Instagram, Decker allowed her fans a glimpse into the next chapter of her life.</p><p>Stepping onto a balcony with a picturesque view of palm trees, she stood dressed in a cropped tank top and underwear. As she turned around, a radiant smile graced her face, and her gently rounded baby bump took center stage. Mariah Carey’s “Always Be My Baby” played in the background, adding a touch of sentimentality to this joyful announcement.</p><p>The Decker family already consists of three vibrant <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">children</a>: five-year-old Forrest Bradley, eight-year-old Eric “Bubby” Jr., and nine-year-old Vivianne Rose. The proud parents have always been candid about their approach to expanding their family. In previous interviews, they’ve stated that they are open to the idea of more children but are also content with letting life unfold naturally.</p><p>Interestingly, her recent announcement resonates with a playful undertone from a gin campaign she starred in earlier this year. In a humorous advertisement for Ryan Reynolds’ Aviation Gin, she created “The Vasectomy Cocktail,” to poke fun at her husband for his resistance to undergo a vasectomy procedure.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jessie James Decker’s Husband Strips Down To Promote Her Cookbook</h2><p>Social media was set abuzz once again as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Decker</a> and her husband Eric showed their unique sense of humor and camaraderie. The couple, known for their lighthearted interactions, recently shared a playful and attention-grabbing post on Instagram to promote Decker’s upcoming cookbook, Just Eat.</p><p>In a throwback to a previous eye-catching post from 2020, she uploaded a daring photo of Eric sitting on a wooden chair in the nude, while also holding her cookbook strategically over his waist. The cheeky image originally garnered attention during the release of her first cookbook, Just Feed Me. This time, however, the couple playfully photoshopped the cover of Just Eat onto the image, creating a humorous visual.</p><p>In the comments section, fans joined in on the fun, expressing a mix of shock, amusement, and praise for Eric’s bold display of support. While some jokingly claimed the image wasn’t “legal on their feed,” others commended his commitment to supporting his wife’s endeavors.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Original_GabbyWindey_RobbyHoffman_ABC_Christopher-Willard-220x147.jpg alt="Former ‘Bachelorette’ Gabby Windey Gets Candid About Exploring Her Sexuality at 32" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yZ6qrKGVYreiucSsZJ2dk6Cys3nAp6WorZ6YsrR5wZqZsmWepHp1edKenGaoopq0r63NnLBmmZ6jvLa6wp6knqakZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kate-middleton-makes-a-rare-appearance-in-a-video-and-people-spot-an-odd-detail-819906.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kate Middleton Makes a Rare Appearance in a Video and People Spot an Odd Detail</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1175412-igbo-cultural-dressing-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Igbo cultural dressing - Legit.ng</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

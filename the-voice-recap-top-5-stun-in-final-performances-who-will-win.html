Tonight, all five singers got to sing two songs, one ballad, and one up-tempo song. Voting is now open until Tuesday at 7 a.m., The Voice’s season 23 winner will be crowned on Tuesday, May 23 at 9 p.m. ET.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-top-five-singers-wow-with-two-songs-each>Top Five Singers Wow With Two Songs Each</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Grace West:</h3><p>Grace kicked off the night as the first singer to perform. For her first performance, she decided to sing “The Night The Lights Went Out in Georgia” by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reba McEntire</a>. Since day one, Grace has been portrayed as a traditional country artist, and that’s exactly what this performance was giving.</p><p>The Team Blake singer’s second song was “She’s Got You” by Patsy Cline. This tune was very classic to the genre, yet Grace shined once again.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>.<a href=#>@gracewestmusic</a> has truly found her lane <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ThVNArHgal</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>May 23, 2023</a><h3 class=wp-block-heading>D.Smooth</h3><p>Team Kelly member D.Smooth was the next artist to go on. For his first song, he sang “My My My” by Johnny Gill. We’ve seen some recent, popular hits from this singer, so it was great to see him perform a ’90’s R&B hit. Although many would see this as risky, I respect the fact that he put more on the line, and showed off a bit more of himself.</p><p>D.Smooth’s second song was yet another great pick. In this round, he sang “What You Won’t Do For Love” by Bobby Caldwell. This song couldn’t have been a better pick for him, he sounded great, and put on a great show.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>there's only one <a href=#>@Thereal_dsmooth</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/m9OZRVqWeJ</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>May 23, 2023</a><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Sorelle</h3><p>Up next was Team Chance trio, Sorelle. The three sisters stunned with “Million Reasons” by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lady Gaga</a>. The group truly shined with this performance, their individual voices broke through their harmonies flawlessly.</p><p>The trio returned to the stage with yet another upbeat song, Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell’s “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough.” From the moment the trio announced this song, I knew it was going to be good. They’ve absolutely slayed their pop hits, so I knew this performance would be good.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>harmonies forever <a href=#>@MABSorelle</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/5j4tuceBCL</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>May 23, 2023</a><h3 class=wp-block-heading>NOIVAS</h3><p>Four-chair turn NOIVAS came back to this round with vengeance. After his impressive journey this season, he proved his place in the finale with “Cold” by Chris Stapleton. The slow, yet heartfelt tune was done perfectly.</p><p>NOIVAS’ final song choice was “Fly Away” by Lenny Kravitz. This was a full circle moment for him, since he used to perform this song with his band in college.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>seeing <a href=#>@noivaswright</a> sing country >>>> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/2G1oa7bdeh</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>May 23, 2023</a><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Gina Miles</h3><p>Team Niall member Gina Miles finished off the first round of performances singing “Style” by Taylor Swift. Gina chose to sing this song to show off a different side of her. This was a completely different song for Gina, but she pulled it off extremely well.</p><p>Finishing out the night was Gina Miles with “Nothing Compares 2 U” by Sinéad O’Connor. Once again, this song was an amazing pick to show off Gina’s insanely beautiful lower register.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Gina Miles singing <a href=#>@taylorswift13</a> !!!!!!!!!! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/FMTtTCMMKZ</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>May 23, 2023</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Which Artist Will Win?</h2><p>Based on tonight’s performances, I could see America’s vote going a few different ways. For starters, it’s no secret that America loves their Team Shelton country artists. Based on that statistic alone, Grace West has a great chance at being the next winner – including the fact that last season’s winner, Bryce Leatherwood, is a country singer.</p><p>I think in terms of uniqueness, both D.Smooth and Gina Miles are head to head. On one hand, D.Smooth has one of the most effortless voices ever, while Gina’s voice impresses each time she walks on stage. If I’m being honest, I would be happy with either of these singers winning.</p><p>Unfortunately, I don’t think NOIVAS or Sorelle will win. I think that both artists are more than amazing, but I’m not sure they have the fan base needed to win. Sorelle doesn’t seem to have the “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Girl Named Tom</a> effect” of being the first trio to make it into the finale, while NOIVAS just feels overlooked all together. I’ve cheered on both artists throughout the competition and hope they get far, but I’ll seriously be surprised if either get crowned as the winner.</p><p>Now that the episode has concluded, voting is now open. Fans can vote via The Voice app as well as on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class=broken_link>The Voice‘s website</a>. Voting closes at 7 a.m. and the winner will be announced on Tuesday, May 23 at 9 p.m. ET. Ahead of The Voice finale part 2 is a one-hour special called “The Cutdown” where artists are able to relive their journey on the show.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Masked-Singer-Andrew-Lloyd-Webber-Night.jpg alt="Andrew Lloyd Webber’s 43-Year Streak Ends Amid Closing of ‘Bad Cinderella’ on Broadway" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmedGempqoXam8sXmUZqqtrZ5itq95xaKlmqRdpbKzss6rpJqmk5rAbsPHqGSwoZyheri1zWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1597057-who-ceedee-lambs-girlfriend-background-dating-life.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is CeeDee Lamb's girlfriend?

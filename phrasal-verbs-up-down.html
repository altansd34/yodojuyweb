To get you started in the right direction during the language learning process, I’ll go over phrasal verbs with the prepositions “up” and “down”.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are phrasal verbs?</h2><p>A phrasal verb is made up of a verb followed by an adverb or a preposition. These particles can <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">change the meaning of a verb</a> to something completely different from the original one.</p><p>“Up” and “down” usually give the verb a sense of verticality, or of something that increases or decreases. The way they change their verbs is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">easier to understand in practice than in theory</a>, so I’ll show you plenty of examples to explain them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Phrasal verbs with up</h2><p>“Up” can change the meaning of the verb it follows and is the most common way to talk about increasing something or moving it vertically. A few examples are:</p><ul><li>Sarah <strong>picked up </strong>her toys from the floor. (the subject <strong>moves </strong>the object <strong>vertically </strong>from a lower point to a higher one)</li><li>I’m late, I will <strong>hurry up</strong>! (the subject is slow and has to <strong>increase </strong>speed if he wants to be on time)</li><li>Grandpa <strong>sat up</strong> in bed and smiled. (the subject <strong>moved vertically </strong>from a lying to a sitting position)</li><li>Can you please <strong>turn up </strong>the volume? (the subject is asked to <strong>increase </strong>the volume)</li></ul><p>But “up” can change the verb’s meaning to something completely different. You must learn these by heart, but don’t worry, they’ll <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">become second nature to you with more practice</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Using “up” with verbs about separation</h3><p>When “up” accompanies a verb that indicates separation, it amplifies the verb’s meaning.</p><ul><li>For example, you could <strong>tear </strong>a hole in your jeans, which would be a minor inconvenience, or you could <strong>tear up</strong> a letter you received, which is far more revealing about your feelings towards it.</li><li>When you <strong>crack up</strong>, it means you are laughing so hard you might break. Conversely, the ice on your patio might <strong>crack,</strong> which means it’s still there, but just with a crack.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>“Up” meaning to improve</h3><p>“Up” can change the meaning of the verb it follows into “improving”.</p><ul><li>If you change from your pajamas to a formal gown, then you <strong>dress up</strong>, meaning to <strong>improve</strong> your style of clothing.</li><li>Imagine this: you had a rough night, you received terrible news. What if I brought you a gift to <strong>cheer</strong> you <strong>up</strong>? My action would <strong>improve</strong> your mood.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>“Up” meaning to finish something</h3><p>Here, “up” is used to describe the completion of an action.</p><ul><li>When Mom told you to <strong>clean up</strong> your room she wasn’t satisfied until it was immaculate. Rightfully so.</li><li>After washing clothes you must wait for them to <strong>dry up</strong>, otherwise, you’d feel the water on your skin, which is uncomfortable.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>“Up” meaning to stop</h3><p>The verb’s meaning can be changed when it’s followed by “up”.</p><ul><li>You can <strong>give</strong> something a try, but if you fail too many times, you will <strong>give up</strong>, which means you stop trying.</li><li>You can <strong>hold</strong> a ball in your hands. But what if traffic <strong>holds</strong> you <strong>up</strong>? It means the traffic stopped you.</li></ul><p>And yet, neither give nor hold mean stop. This is the power of “up”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Phrasal verbs with down</h2><p>“Down” acts similarly to “up”, in the sense that it changes the meaning of the verb it follows.&nbsp;</p><p>Much like “up”, the most common meaning of “down” is that of moving things vertically, as well as moving downwards or decreasing. For example:</p><ul><li>He <strong>put down</strong> the barbell after the workout. (the subject <strong>drops </strong>the barbell after using it)</li><li>My mom <strong>turned down</strong> the volume of the TV after I asked her. (the subject <strong>decreases</strong> the TV’s volume)</li><li>Please <strong>calm down.</strong> (the speaker asks the subject to <strong>reduce</strong> their anger)</li></ul><p>In all the examples, the subject is moving or reducing something to a lower point.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>“Down” as an intensifier</h3><p>The particle makes the action expressed by the verb <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">stronger</a>.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>You can <strong>hunt</strong> a wild boar. But you can also <strong>hunt down</strong> a criminal. “Hunt down” is a stronger form of “hunt”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>You can <strong>burn</strong> a letter to dispose of it. But forests can <strong>burn down</strong>, which means they get completely destroyed by fire.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>“Down” can change the verb’s meaning</h3><p>Just like “up”, “down” can change the meaning of its verb. But unlike “up”, we can’t easily categorise phrasal verbs with “down”.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s easy to understand the meaning of the verb with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">practice</a>. Let’s see some examples:</p><ul><li>The government is trying to <strong>crack down</strong> on alcohol consumption. (the subject is taking severe measures <strong>against</strong> something)</li><li>John <strong>let</strong> me <strong>down</strong> yesterday. (the subject <strong>disappointed</strong> me)</li><li>Water can <strong>wear down</strong> a mountain. (the subject <strong>erodes/weakens</strong> the object)</li></ul><p>Overall, phrasal verbs are a super essential element of becoming a fluent English speaker, so it’s best to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">start practising as much as you can</a>!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/lingoda-2020-favicon.png><h2>Adriana Stein</h2><p>Adriana Stein is an Online Marketing Consultant based in Hamburg, Germany.

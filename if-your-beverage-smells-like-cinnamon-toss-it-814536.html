Chances are that someone has messed with your drink and tried adding some ingredients that shouldn’t really be&nbsp;there. Cinnamon has the superpower of&nbsp;covering up&nbsp;the smell and taste of&nbsp;other substances. So, the best you can do&nbsp;is&nbsp;never leave your drink alone and always sniff it&nbsp;before drinking.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b86/97b/fec3035adab59801af9a37e471.png><p>In&nbsp;case you can clearly smell a&nbsp;dirty wet dog in&nbsp;your pet-free house, you might have some uninvited guests. Check your attic for rodents, raccoons, or&nbsp;squirrels. All those animals can use your <a href=# title=rafters data-link=tag>rafters</a> as&nbsp;their bathroom. If&nbsp;you find leftovers of&nbsp;their activities, don’t play cool and take it&nbsp;all out yourself&nbsp;— call pest control instead.</p><p>If&nbsp;your house suddenly starts smelling like rotten eggs, I&nbsp;have some bad news for you. It&nbsp;might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;natural <a href=# title=gas data-link=tag>gas</a> leak, so&nbsp;you should get your <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> out of&nbsp;the house. The gas itself doesn’t smell like anything, but they add a&nbsp;sulfur-like scent to&nbsp;it&nbsp;to&nbsp;detect leaks easier. Leave the door and windows open to&nbsp;let the gas escape. Call the local gas company to&nbsp;inform them about the problem. They should give you instructions on&nbsp;what to&nbsp;do&nbsp;next.</p><p>If&nbsp;you only feel this smell when hot water is&nbsp;running, there’re probably some sulfur bacteria in&nbsp;the water itself. They feed on&nbsp;decomposing organic matter and produce hydrogen sulfide gas in&nbsp;the plumbing system. Call a&nbsp;plumber and ask them to&nbsp;shut the water line and drain the tank to&nbsp;refill it&nbsp;with clean water.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/182/a21/a17f005d8e834368f516e2bb5b.png><p>You wake up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the smell of&nbsp;<a href=# title=seafood data-link=tag>seafood</a>. Mmmmmm, fish stew. But wait! You don’t remember buying or&nbsp;cooking any seafood lately. A&nbsp;fishy smell could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;sign some electrical fixture in&nbsp;your house is&nbsp;overheating and melting its insulating rubber or&nbsp;plastic. It’s most likely the <a href=# title=dishwasher data-link=tag>dishwasher</a>, your washing machine, or&nbsp;an&nbsp;air conditioner.</p><p>If&nbsp;you just ignore the problem and enjoy that smell for longer, it&nbsp;can cause you some serious trouble, such as&nbsp;a&nbsp;fire. Sniff near all the appliances in&nbsp;the house to&nbsp;identify the source of&nbsp;the smell. When you find the source, call a&nbsp;repair expert or&nbsp;get a&nbsp;replacement if&nbsp;that dishwasher is&nbsp;40&nbsp;years old. If&nbsp;you believe an&nbsp;outlet or&nbsp;switch is&nbsp;the source, shut off your circuit breaker and invite an&nbsp;electrician to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;it.</p><p>If&nbsp;you’re smelling burnt toast, although nobody is&nbsp;making it&nbsp;as&nbsp;you live alone, it&nbsp;could be&nbsp;an&nbsp;electrical wiring issue. Check your wall outlets and all extension cords to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;they’re overheated. Open the electric panel box. If&nbsp;it&nbsp;turns out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the source of&nbsp;the smell, call an&nbsp;electrician for help.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/dab/b98/43e5e25c2f905d7b97d3f31dd3.png><p>If&nbsp;the tap water in&nbsp;your house suddenly tastes like metal, you should most likely blame it&nbsp;on&nbsp;your good old piping. Looks like it&nbsp;has been slowly dripping into the water, adding some zinc, iron, and copper to&nbsp;it. It’s normal if&nbsp;you’ve been using the system for years, but in&nbsp;really old houses, it&nbsp;could also add dangerous lead to&nbsp;the mix. It&nbsp;could also mean your water is&nbsp;acidic, and it&nbsp;could erode the plumbing.</p><p>The best you can do&nbsp;is&nbsp;use a&nbsp;water softener or&nbsp;neutralizing filter to&nbsp;balance the water you’re going to&nbsp;drink back to&nbsp;a&nbsp;normal pH&nbsp;level. Pencil shavings are a&nbsp;pretty exotic smell for tap water, but it&nbsp;happens when the vital liquid is&nbsp;going through plastic pipes. The reason is&nbsp;the anti-oxidants found in&nbsp;those pipes, so&nbsp;the only way to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;the smell is&nbsp;to&nbsp;get new plumbing.</p><p>In&nbsp;case there’s a&nbsp;musty odor coming from a&nbsp;fireplace you never use, the first thing you have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;check if&nbsp;the chimney dampers are closed. If&nbsp;they’re perfectly sealed, try vacuuming and scrubbing the firebox. That’s the area at&nbsp;the base of&nbsp;the chimney where the fire&nbsp;is. If&nbsp;none of&nbsp;that helps, you’ll need to&nbsp;call a&nbsp;chimney sweeper to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;your chimney. There might be&nbsp;water inside of&nbsp;it, so&nbsp;a&nbsp;professional should help you seal it&nbsp;for good.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/851/d6c/4ca884587bb9bf63b0ad067936.png><p>Does the water in&nbsp;your house smell like a&nbsp;swimming pool? Yikes! It’s most likely full of&nbsp;chlorine. It’s a&nbsp;disinfectant people have used in&nbsp;cities for over a&nbsp;century, so&nbsp;if&nbsp;you get water from your municipality, that’s pretty normal.</p><p>Chlorine is&nbsp;the worst nightmare for bacteria and parasites but is&nbsp;safe for humans, mammals, and birds, when in&nbsp;reasonable amounts. If&nbsp;you have amphibians or&nbsp;aquatic pets at&nbsp;home, though, you gotta make sure they don’t drink&nbsp;it. If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;that smell, try getting a&nbsp;carbon filtration system for your home.</p><p>Does your house smell like the gym locker? First, check if&nbsp;you have any sweaty socks or&nbsp;t-shirts hiding somewhere&nbsp;— they like to&nbsp;hide under the bed or&nbsp;behind the couch. If&nbsp;that doesn’t work, there might be&nbsp;some bacteria growing in&nbsp;your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system.</p><p>Seasons like spring and fall, when temperatures change, and there’s more condensation than usual, are the perfect time for those bacteria to&nbsp;thrive. You can either try to&nbsp;solve the problem with specialized cleaning products or&nbsp;call a&nbsp;professional for help.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9fc/69f/283d3e5fedab6bd20af3d6939c.png><p>The opposite of&nbsp;the gym locker is&nbsp;that nice all “new” smell in&nbsp;the house. It’s okay when you’ve just finished painting the walls, got some new furniture, carpeting, or&nbsp;floors. But if&nbsp;the smell is&nbsp;super strong or&nbsp;stays after a&nbsp;while, it&nbsp;means some organic compounds are in&nbsp;the air. They aren’t exactly healthy to&nbsp;breathe&nbsp;in.</p><p>Open all windows and run fans to&nbsp;make the air move around for at&nbsp;least an&nbsp;hour. Keep repeating it&nbsp;with breaks during the entire day. Next time you want to&nbsp;renovate the house, make sure to&nbsp;remove new pressed-wood furniture or&nbsp;carpeting from their packaging and leave them overnight in&nbsp;the garage. All the dangerous substances should air out by&nbsp;the time you bring your purchase inside. If&nbsp;the “new” smell doesn’t go&nbsp;away after a&nbsp;month&nbsp;— ask for a&nbsp;replacement.</p><p>Unless you like drinking lake water, you won’t be&nbsp;happy if&nbsp;the liquid coming from your tap suddenly smells fishy. Just like with lake water, it&nbsp;means there are some bacteria in&nbsp;the system, and organic matter like decaying leaves or&nbsp;plants could be&nbsp;to&nbsp;blame. There isn’t much you can do&nbsp;with your internal plumbing system, but you can try contacting your water provider and informing them of&nbsp;the problem. It’s their task to&nbsp;monitor the levels of&nbsp;organic compounds in&nbsp;the water.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/231/6d1/d3dcca52e888270cfc3f52987f.png><p>When you turn on&nbsp;the heat after the warm season and feel the burning smell around the house, don’t worry. The dust that was accumulating in&nbsp;the system over the summer just has to&nbsp;burn away. The smell should disappear after a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;hours of&nbsp;heating working again. You might want to&nbsp;replace the filter in&nbsp;the heating system at&nbsp;least once in&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;years, though.</p><p>Your front-load washer might smell like sewage and mold because it’s in&nbsp;constant contact with water. Every time you open and close the washer, moisture from its hard work stays in&nbsp;the seal. That’s the perfect environment for smelly bacteria. If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;stop their breeding, leave the washer door and the detergent drawer open for a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;hours after every load. If&nbsp;you see mold in&nbsp;there, try mixing white vinegar and baking soda 1:1 to&nbsp;wipe the mold off.</p><p>The terrible metallic smell in&nbsp;your house that feels like ammonia is&nbsp;actually&nbsp;it. If&nbsp;you clean with ammonia or&nbsp;use a&nbsp;coolant based on&nbsp;it, it&nbsp;could be&nbsp;leaking from somewhere. Check out the household appliances that use the coolant. If&nbsp;you don’t have any, the smell of&nbsp;ammonia could come from mold that’s hiding somewhere in&nbsp;your house or&nbsp;a&nbsp;rodent that ended its life inside your walls. In&nbsp;any case, don’t ignore this smell as&nbsp;it&nbsp;won’t just go&nbsp;away.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLanediorKtlkprDpr7AoJxmq52aua2%2FjKWgpJ1dmLavusCmpqdlpKTAtHnIrWRxaWRqgHd7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./intimate-scenes-between-jenna-ortega-21-and-martin-freeman-52-in-a-new-movie-are-sparking-debate-817888.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Intimate Scenes Between Jenna Ortega, 21, and Martin Freeman, 52, in a New Movie Is Facing Backlash</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./i-hated-the-surprise-birthday-party-my-husband-threw-me-and-now-i-want-a-divorce-819847.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>I Hated the Surprise Birthday Party My Husband Threw Me and Now I Want a Divorce</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

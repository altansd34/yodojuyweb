Think of how you would have felt had it been your wedding? It really was a terrible way to start pushing your nonnegotiable views and break ties. Shouldn't you have been trying to create a bond in order to be an important family member. I think too many, mother in-laws believe that imposing their power on their daughter in-laws is okay. Clearly it's not. You were once a daughter in-law. More importantly, it really seems that respect has gone completely out the door. No one wants to give it, nor show a miniscule of it. Respect is earned but one must give in order to receive. Once you've lost respect for someone it's more difficult to regain it. If you want your son to forgive you, you must apologize to his wife because it was her wedding not yours. Her choice was her own dilemma to own, but you turned it into a force of power. All about you. Have a conscience, stop being so naive that you think you're right. Bind the bridge or part ways, with your son and daughter in-law. Own your mistake.</p><p>Despite your initial resistance, consider <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>apologizing sincerely</strong></a> to your daughter-in-law for going against her wishes. Express regret for not respecting her choice and<strong> causing distress on a day that meant a lot to her.</strong></p><p>Offer to make amends by hosting a family dinner or event where she can plan the menu according to her preferences,<strong> demonstrating your willingness to support her decisions </strong>and reconcile the relationship.</p><p><h2>Family mediation and resolution.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/93f/1c5/ec75ff5ab8a7d2452beae9a5bc.jpg><p>If tensions persist, suggest involving <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>a neutral third party</strong></a>, like a family therapist or mediator, to facilitate a constructive dialogue between you, your son, and your daughter-in-law.</p><p>This can provide <strong>a structured environment</strong> to address underlying issues, clarify misunderstandings, and work towards rebuilding trust and harmony within the family unit.</p><p><h2>Set boundaries and respect differences.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/afb/8d1/eb2a785f46bb23a4613419cbf8.jpg><p>Establish<strong> </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>clear boundaries</strong></a><strong> for future family events </strong>regarding dietary preferences and other sensitive matters.

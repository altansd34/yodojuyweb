He has tweeted in support of Black Lives Matter and called out racism by his former employer, the NFL. But it was his latest comments that he made on Twitter that really had the world shocked, questioning what he exactly meant when he used the phrase “black supremacy.”</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Defeating White supremacy without White people creates Black supremacy. Equality is the truth.</p><p>Like it or not, we are all in this together.</p>— Terry Crews (@terrycrews) <a href=#>June 7, 2020</a></figure><p>The tweet in question says “Defeating White supremacy without White people creates Black supremacy. Equality is the truth. Like it or not, we are all in this together.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Terry Crews Angered People With His Tweet About ‘Black Supremacy’</h2><p>Crews instantly received a lot of backlash almost immediately after the tweet was posted. Several people interpreted it as him saying black supremacy is very prominent, especially right now in the wake of the death of George Floyd. In one reply to actor Tyler James Williams, Crews explained what he meant further, seemingly recognizing that people were not happy with his tweets. Crews explained that he just wants black people and white people to work together because that is the only way racism and white supremacists can be taken down.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I understand, Tyler. I was not saying Black supremacy exists, because it doesn't. I am saying if both Black and Whites don't continue to work together– bad attitudes and resentments can create a dangerous self-righteousness. That's all. <a href=#>https://t.co/YLWGnpj8fl</a></p>— Terry Crews (@terrycrews) <a href=#>June 8, 2020</a></figure><p>Comedian Godfrey also replied to Crews’ tweets with a powerful phrase that says “black pride isn’t anti-white.” Crews then agreed with this and said that for him personally, he has been called out for not being “black enough.” There genuinely was a full debate all across Twitter about what he actually meant by these tweets and how it does not add any support to the Black Lives Matter movement.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I agree. I'm not discussing white people here. there are "gatekeepers of Blackness" within our own community who decide who's Black and who's not. I have often been called out for not being "black enough". How can that be? <a href=#>https://t.co/Tt9Og866x6</a></p>— Terry Crews (@terrycrews) <a href=#>June 8, 2020</a></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# class=broken_link>RAPPER TOKYO JETZ POSTS TEARFUL APOLOGY VIDEO FOR GEORGE FLOYD JOKE</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>People Continued To Criticize Crews For His Remarks</h3><p>If you take one look at the replies to Crews’ tweets in the past day, you will see that people are shocked and outraged by them. This could either be because they are misinterpreting what he is saying, or because they genuinely feel like Crews thinks black supremacy exists. One Twitter user wrote, “#TerryCrews stays throwing black Americans under the bus.” Others compared him to his character in the film White Chicks who only dated white women. Another tweet said, “So Terry Crews really wasn’t playing a character in White Chicks….” which seemed like a popular thought amongst the outraged people.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><p>Other tweets referenced Crews <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>not supporting Gabrielle Union</a> when she first spoke out about the toxic work environment on America’s Got Talent. He initially said Union was hiding behind unnamed sources and that her claims about racism were not what he personally experienced on the show.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>What do the WHITES have on Terry Crews?!</p>— Kevín (@KevOnStage) <a href=#>June 8, 2020</a></figure><p>Some people on Twitter think it has all come full circle, and that Crews does not support the rest of the black community. He has since retracted those statements and <a href=#>supports Union.</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><p>This prompted the America’s Got Talent host to put out more tweets trying to further explain his thought process. He emphasized how important he thinks dialogue is to allow people to formulate their own opinions.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I believe it is important we not suffer from groupthink, and we keep minds of our own, and be allowed to ask difficult questions to each other.

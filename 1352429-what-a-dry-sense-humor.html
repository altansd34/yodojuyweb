They do not smile, and neither do they laugh or make silly faces.</p><p class=align-left>It is also known as deadpan humor, with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">deadpan meaning</a> that the joke cracker is very impassive and has a matter-of-fact tone with no or the least display of emotions.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/22b44c8ce6fbdeaf.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>75+ small women's unique hand tattoos to enhance your look</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The joke may be a mere statement that the person is making about a current situation or occurrence. The outrageous and cleverly implied manner in which they make the statement makes it so funny and sometimes challenging to understand.</p><p class=align-left>Normally, it is not funny and is context or situation-dependent. A witty person says things and feeds jokes into every situation without even knowing that they are being funny.</p><p class=align-left>When someone asks, "What is dry humor?" it is essential to note that it is "supposed" to be condescending by its name and nature. For this reason, most people have the misconception that the person delivering the joke is also naturally condescending and arrogant.</p><p class=align-left>While this may be true in some cases, it should be understood that the person is merely putting an air of superiority and patronizing behavior so that their joke has the desired effect on the audience.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4cb2206573354c50.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>75+ funny celebrity quotes that will make you chuckle a bit</span></p></a><p class=align-left>NB: It is the responsibility of the person <a href=#>cracking the joke</a> to ensure that their words do not take a toll on someone who is not as good a <a href=#>sport</a> as he is expected to be.

Be observant of the world around you</h4><p class=align-left>Good observational skills are crucial in dry comedy. Deeply observe people, their idiosyncrasies, and their situations. This will help you come up with jokes.</p><h4>2. Master the art of wordplay</h4><p class=align-left>Playing with common and easy-to-understand words has great importance. Aim to attract people with your wit.</p><h4>3. Read widely</h4><p class=align-left>Adopt the habit of reading the works of great humorists like Robert Benchley. Reading can help you cultivate a sense of humor that inspires others.</p><h4>4. Always see the larger picture</h4><p class=align-left>Do not take life too seriously that it renders resistance to humor. Do not let the monotony of life kill the clown within.</p><p class=align-left>Instead, allow yourself to get infected with humor. View the bigger picture despite your worries.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/fe931ad54816ae58.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ funny shower thoughts to ponder while you shampoo your hair</span></p></a><h3>Dry humor examples</h3><p class=align-left>Below are a few examples to help you understand what dry humor is.</p><ul><li>I've never been married, but I tell people I'm divorced so they won't think something is wrong with me.<i> - Elayne Boosler</i></li><li>Our bombs are smarter than the average high school student.

Mastering <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">deadpan humor</a> takes time and plenty of effort.</p><p class=align-left>Some of the tips and tricks that you can use to become a better deadpan comedian are:</p><h4>1. Use sarcasm as your weapon of choice</h4><p class=align-left>If people have told you before that you are the most sarcastic person they know, use that to your advantage. Over time, they will learn to take most things you say with a pinch of salt and warm up to you and your sarcasm.</p><h4>2. Consider yourself an amateur psychologist</h4><p class=align-left>Although people may sometimes find it hard to read you, you have the ability to read other people like a book. All the imaginative interpretations and cynicism in you allow you to figure people out and quickly make you savvy to their motives.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/51dcf84dd675f437.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is an exclusive relationship, and how should it work?</span></p></a><h4>3. Do not be too worried about what people say</h4><p class=align-left>Know who you are and where you stand. You are not seeking anyone's approval. In the grand scheme, what other people think of you is entirely up to them, so focus on becoming a better deadpan comedian.</p><h4>4. Embrace the fact that cynicism is part of who you are</h4><p class=align-left>Be proud of your cynicism. You are not necessarily distrusting of everything; it is just that you know how easy it is for people to be unreliable or incapable, so you always have your guard up.</p><h4>5. Always use your intelligence and wit</h4><p class=align-left>People may think that deadpan comedy is simplistic, but it takes a lot of brainpower to construct a decent joke that is not obvious and has an obscure structure.</p><p class=align-left>Using your intellect will make it easier to dissect unfunny situations and make them funny.</p><p class=align-left>When you find yourself in a tricky situation, talk your way out of it. Your wit will refine over the years, and you will learn how to outwit nearly anyone you encounter.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c53e2582d6d14f62.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Interesting Aries facts about that fiery person in your life</span></p></a><h4>6. Accept that not everyone will get you</h4><p class=align-left>Sometimes, some people will think that your jokes are slightly tasteless, but that is just because they are not on the same page.</p><p class=align-left>As a deadpan comedian, you do not set out to hurt anyone's feelings, but you should enjoy seeing how far you can push the envelope with comedy. Sometimes, people will take that the wrong way.</p><h4>7. Turn disastrous situations into a goldmine</h4><p class=align-left>When someone fails spectacularly, says something awkward, or does something stupid, give fast quips about the situation.</p><h2>Are deadpan jokes good or bad?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/63e03eafd7490602.jpg><p class=align-left>Deadpan<a href=#> jokes are good</a> only if they are used correctly and with an appropriate audience.

Many directors want to&nbsp;make the perfect movie, and of&nbsp;course, they want to&nbsp;hire the best actors and actresses possible for the roles of&nbsp;the classic characters.</p><p>And the opinions of&nbsp;critics and viewers about the actors that play these classic characters in&nbsp;movies are often different. We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> remembered some famous actors that had a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;play the same characters and we&nbsp;found the opinions of&nbsp;critics, journalists, and movie creators about the best casting decisions and the disappointments.</p><p><h2>1. Sherlock Holmes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/829/78a/c4cec15bc082489adf058c8453.jpg><p>Back in&nbsp;the day, the genius <a href=#>English detective</a> was portrayed by&nbsp;<strong>Vasily Livanov</strong> in&nbsp;The Adventures of&nbsp;<a href=# title="Sherlock Holmes" data-link=tag>Sherlock Holmes</a> and Dr. Watson (1979–1986), <strong>Robert Downey&nbsp;Jr.</strong> in&nbsp;Sherlock Holmes (2009), and <strong><a href=# title="Benedict Cumberbatch" data-link=tag>Benedict Cumberbatch</a></strong> in&nbsp;Sherlock (2010).</p><p>In&nbsp;Russia, Vasily Livanov is&nbsp;believed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the best Sherlock, and Conan Doyle’s daughter <a href=#>agrees</a> with this sentiment. She said that her father would’ve totally approved of&nbsp;the character the actor portrayed on&nbsp;screen. Vasily Livanov is&nbsp;also the only actor that played Sherlock to&nbsp;<a href=#>receive</a> the Most Excellent Order of&nbsp;the British Empire from the Queen for his work.</p><p>The Sherlock that Robert Downey&nbsp;Jr. portrayed onscreen is&nbsp;very far from the classic variant, but the actor <a href=#>won</a> a&nbsp;Golden Globe for it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the Best Actor category.</p><p>Benedict Cumberbatch showed Sherlock the way he&nbsp;would look today and it&nbsp;took viewers a&nbsp;long time to&nbsp;accept this way of&nbsp;telling such a&nbsp;classic story. Because the only thing that was the same as&nbsp;the books was the direction of&nbsp;the story. But the charm of&nbsp;the <a href=#>super-insightful</a> Sherlock, in&nbsp;the duo with Martin Freeman as&nbsp;Doctor Watson, eventually won everyone over.</p><p><h2>2. Conan the Barbarian</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e89/9fa/676e8954f5a80f6e463e68a3ab.jpg><p>Conan the Barbarian was portrayed by&nbsp;2&nbsp;actors: <strong><a href=# title="Arnold Schwarzenegger" data-link=tag>Arnold Schwarzenegger</a></strong> in&nbsp;1982, and <strong><a href=# title="Jason Momoa" data-link=tag>Jason Momoa</a></strong> in&nbsp;2011.</p><p><a href=#>Critics</a> thought that the character of&nbsp;Conan was one of&nbsp;the best roles Arnold Schwarzenegger has ever done. Together with the director, Schwarzenegger worked on&nbsp;his pronunciation and facial expressions. He&nbsp;practiced constantly to&nbsp;build up&nbsp;his sword fighting skills and look as&nbsp;natural as&nbsp;possible in&nbsp;these scenes. Let’s not even mention the fact that the movie had almost zero special effects&nbsp;— all the visual splendor was created by&nbsp;the crew and the actors.</p><p>Jason Momoa was “the second Conan.” So, of&nbsp;course, it&nbsp;was impossible to&nbsp;avoid being <a href=#>compared</a> to&nbsp;Schwarzenegger. Momoa disappointed critics with his Conan portrayal because he&nbsp;seemed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;too <a href=#>thin and awkward</a>. But fortunately, not everyone thought this. Other critics praised the actor for showing a&nbsp;totally different side of&nbsp;Conan. And of&nbsp;course, the acting was a&nbsp;bit debatable, some people thought it&nbsp;was far from perfect, while others said that the actor showed the character in&nbsp;a&nbsp;different light.</p><p><h2>3. Scarlett O’Hara</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f0f/c27/72216c53ac84426abb46b3174c.jpg><p><strong>Vivien Leigh</strong> portrayed Scarlett O’Hara from the original novel Gone With the Wind, by&nbsp;Margaret Mitchell. And <strong>Joanne Whalley </strong>portrayed Scarlett from the sequel to&nbsp;the story written by&nbsp;a&nbsp;different author, Alexandra Ripley, whose novel is&nbsp;called Scarlett.</p><p>So, while the actresses portrayed very different characters, the viewers still compared them. Vivien Leigh portrayed a&nbsp;young Scarlett&nbsp;— selfish, explosive, persistent, and scandalous. It’s interesting that Margaret Mitchell actually planned for Scarlett to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;negative character, opposite Melanie. Margaret Mitchell described herself in&nbsp;Melanie’s character. But the viewers loved Scarlett, who <a href=#>became</a> a&nbsp;symbol of&nbsp;the power of&nbsp;spirit, a&nbsp;strong temper, and the ability to&nbsp;survive. Mitchell was very disappointed with this.</p><p>The older Scarlett, portrayed by&nbsp;<a href=#>Joanne Whalley</a>, was very different. She became wise, balanced, and calculating. It’s possible that Margaret Mitchell would’ve portrayed her this way, but unfortunately she never made part&nbsp;2.</p><p><h2>4. James Bond</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1c4/52a/fad1d057ea8cecec5b80428e63.jpg><p><strong>Sean Connery</strong>, <strong><a href=# title="Pierce Brosnan" data-link=tag>Pierce Brosnan</a></strong>, and <strong>Daniel Craig</strong> have become some of&nbsp;the most famous actors to&nbsp;ever portray <a href=#>James Bond</a>. However, throughout history, this character was portrayed by&nbsp;at&nbsp;least <a href=#>7&nbsp;different actors</a> in&nbsp;film alone, in&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;radio and television versions of&nbsp;the character.</p><p><a href=#>Connery </a>is&nbsp;<a href=#>the only actor</a> among those that played Bond that has an&nbsp;Oscar and his portrayal of&nbsp;this character is&nbsp;claimed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the best. The famous Scottish actor was <a href=#>scared</a> that he&nbsp;would forever remain in&nbsp;this singular role, yet he&nbsp;still appeared in&nbsp;5&nbsp;movies.</p><p><a href=#>Pierce Brosnan</a> appeared in&nbsp;4&nbsp;movies and left the franchise at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;49. After Timothy Dalton, Mel Gibson was supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;Bond, but he&nbsp;<a href=#>refused to&nbsp;take the role</a>. In&nbsp;the end, viewers <a href=#>said</a> that the Bond played by&nbsp;Brosnan seemed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the most reliable, confident, and trustworthy.</p><p><a href=#>Daniel Craig</a> was the first blonde Bond. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;also the <a href=#>highest-paid</a> <a href=# title="James Bond" data-link=tag>James Bond</a> of&nbsp;all. And for some <a href=#>viewers</a>, Craig’s Bond is&nbsp;not only a&nbsp;cool special agent, but also a&nbsp;living and breathing human.</p><p><h2>5. Hercule Poirot</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5e3/b80/da6bec56c9a8d8e807352d1948.jpg><p><strong>David Suchet</strong> from Agatha Christie’s Poirot (1989–2013) and <strong>Kenneth Branagh</strong> from Murder on&nbsp;the Orient Express (2017) are the most famous actors that played the unusual detective.</p><p>David Suchet got into the character right away&nbsp;— he&nbsp;even said that he&nbsp;literally wanted to&nbsp;“become Poirot.” His acting was praised by&nbsp;Agatha Christie’s descendants and her grandchild Mathew Prichard, even <a href=#>said</a>, “Personally, I&nbsp;regret very much that she never saw David Suchet. I&nbsp;think that visually he&nbsp;is&nbsp;much the most convincing.”</p><p>Kenneth Branagh <a href=#>portrayed</a> the detective surrounded by&nbsp;an&nbsp;amazing cast: Penélope Cruz, Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, Derek Jacobi, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Daisy Ridley. Despite the mixed reviews, the movie earned more than $351 million worldwide and Branagh’s Poirot will return in&nbsp;a&nbsp;sequel that is&nbsp;supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;released in&nbsp;2020. A&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;viewers complained that the actor hid his acting under his big mustache.</p><p><h2>6. Emma</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/63b/9d8/ca4b075a21939498b668f04a1a.jpg><p>The romantic Emma from Jane Austen’s Emma has been portrayed by&nbsp;<strong>Kate Beckinsale</strong>, <strong>Gwyneth Paltrow</strong> (both movies were released in&nbsp;1996), and <strong>Anya Taylor-Joy</strong> (2020).</p><p>Gwyneth Paltrow, <a href=#>according</a> to&nbsp;reviewers, portrayed the image of&nbsp;idyllic Emma, and the movie itself was focused more on&nbsp;the feelings of&nbsp;the characters.</p><p>Kate Beckinsale <a href=#>portrayed</a> Emma in&nbsp;a&nbsp;more realistic and dramatic movie adaptation. The authors of&nbsp;the adaptation focused on&nbsp;the social customs, rules, and on&nbsp;the way the social norms were maintained at&nbsp;the time. But the character seemed to&nbsp;lack emotional development: Emma’s character was static, unlike who she was in&nbsp;the novel.</p><p>Anya Taylor-Joy showed Emma the way she could have been in&nbsp;the 21st century, and the script was adapted in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;show her personality better. The movie raises the issues of&nbsp;feminism and challenges sexist laws. The modern version of&nbsp;the movie was <a href=#>highly praised</a> by&nbsp;critics: they said it&nbsp;was bold, funny, and that the casting was very good.</p><p>Have you seen these movies?

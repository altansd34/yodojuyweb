Some children have favorite toys that are unique. But there are also some products for children that millions of&nbsp;them love. For example, the Nerf blasters that any boy would love to&nbsp;play with, or&nbsp;the LOL dolls that girls around the world are asking their parents for. But who invented all these things?</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> decided to&nbsp;find out who is&nbsp;behind the creation of&nbsp;the products our children are ready to&nbsp;spend all their pocket money&nbsp;on. And in&nbsp;the bonus, you will find out the <a href=# title=history data-link=tag>history</a> of&nbsp;the game that you probably love.</p><p><h2>LOL dolls</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b3b/3c0/08b2785e5faad17df8a57bea3a.png><p>Isaac Larian, the <a href=#>CEO</a> of&nbsp;MGA Entertainment, had the <a href=#>idea</a> of&nbsp;creating these dolls. When he&nbsp;couldn’t sleep one night, he&nbsp;was watching popular YouTube videos and found that certain videos that showed unpacking toys got a&nbsp;huge number of&nbsp;views. Then, he&nbsp;realized that he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;come up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;toy that would be&nbsp;interesting to&nbsp;unpack.</p><p>With a&nbsp;team, <strong>Larian created small dolls with big eyes that are wrapped in&nbsp;plastic balls and <a href=#>7&nbsp;layers</a> of&nbsp;film</strong>. The main feature of&nbsp;the toy is&nbsp;that while a&nbsp;child is&nbsp;unwrapping&nbsp;it, they see little <a href=# title=surprises data-link=tag>surprises</a> under each layer. And in&nbsp;the end, they get the doll itself.</p><p>When Larian offered his invention to&nbsp;Walmart, it&nbsp;was turned down. They said nobody would buy this toy because you can’t see&nbsp;it. But they were totally wrong and LOL became the hit of&nbsp;the decade.</p><p><h2>Fidget spinner</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/45f/c05/1bee765eeda84384835842559b.jpg><p>The history of&nbsp;creating of&nbsp;this toy is&nbsp;very mysterious. Catherine Hettinger <a href=#>created</a> this toy in&nbsp;1997 for her daughter. Catherine was suffering from myasthenia gravis, an&nbsp;autoimmune disorder that causes muscle weakness which made it&nbsp;hard for her to&nbsp;play with her daughter. So, she created a&nbsp;turning device that could keep the little girl’s attention for a&nbsp;long time. <strong>Also, according to&nbsp;Hettinger, the toy <a href=#>was supposed</a> to&nbsp;help children <a href=#>calm</a> down</strong>.</p><p>But the spinner as&nbsp;we&nbsp;know it&nbsp;today was <a href=#>patented</a> in&nbsp;2016 by&nbsp;Scott McCoskery. He&nbsp;made it&nbsp;by&nbsp;himself and used it&nbsp;to&nbsp;battle anxiety. Soon, he&nbsp;started getting orders for fidget spinners from his friends and then from people he&nbsp;didn’t even know.</p><p><h2>Hoverboard</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6cc/a2b/5aa9b75d82ac19ba9257aaed15.jpg><p>Today, every teenager would probably love to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;hoverboard. The invention that seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;too cool and modern, actually appeared in&nbsp;the ’90s of&nbsp;the previous century. <strong>The prototype of&nbsp;hoverboards was the Segway: a&nbsp;similar-looking device that has a&nbsp;handle to&nbsp;make turns</strong>.</p><p>They were <a href=#>invented</a> by&nbsp;Dean L. Kamen. Interestingly, the owner of&nbsp;Segway Inc., Jimi Heselden, <a href=#>died</a> in&nbsp;an&nbsp;accident while using his own product.</p><p>Later, Chinese engineers started to&nbsp;modernize this device and, over time, they figured out how to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;the handle and teach the device to&nbsp;make turns with the shift of&nbsp;the center of&nbsp;gravity. The first hoverboards appeared at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the 2010s.</p><p><h2>LEGO</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/310/c81/6b5b1c566aaf40b75c98af16ae.jpg><p>The company, that is&nbsp;now producing possibly the most famous toy in&nbsp;the world, was created by&nbsp;<a href=#>Ole Kirk Christiansen</a> in&nbsp;1916. In&nbsp;his workshop, he&nbsp;made different wooden things for home. But once, there was a&nbsp;fire and all the materials burned. The only product his company continued to&nbsp;make were the toys for children that you didn’t need a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;wood to&nbsp;make, but they were painted in&nbsp;bright colors.</p><p>The company was named LEGO from the Danish leg godt&nbsp;— play good. In&nbsp;1947, LEGO started producing plastic toys, including the famous <a href=#>blocks</a>.</p><p><h2>Minecraft</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/138/9db/7e9c85596db20d4c4d4df793a3.jpg><p>This game is&nbsp;just as&nbsp;interesting as&nbsp;making things with LEGOs. Here, the player is&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;3D&nbsp;world made of&nbsp;cubes that you can build however you want. The video game was officially released in&nbsp;<a href=#>2011</a> <strong>and the developer is&nbsp;Markus Persson also known as&nbsp;Notch</strong>.</p><p>The game became popular among adults and children. During the first year, it&nbsp;made the creator a&nbsp;millionaire. Markus <a href=#>published</a> a&nbsp;comment on&nbsp;Reddit where he&nbsp;said that he&nbsp;was surprised with the money he’d suddenly earned, because he&nbsp;had grown up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;poor family. He&nbsp;spent some of&nbsp;the money on&nbsp;the well-being of&nbsp;his relatives and some&nbsp;— he&nbsp;gave to&nbsp;charity.</p><p><h2>Nerf</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8e6/bb6/2d23f65308854f6e0bc5d5ad0f.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1969, inventor <a href=#>Reyn Guyer</a> came to&nbsp;the Parker Brothers. His idea was a&nbsp;home <a href=# title=football data-link=tag>football</a> game that could be&nbsp;used inside the house. It&nbsp;included a&nbsp;ball that was light and small.</p><p>The Parker Brothers decided to&nbsp;only keep the ball. It&nbsp;was the first product sold and branded as&nbsp;Nerf. The company executives realized that it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;hit and <strong>developed the idea, adding pneumatic <a href=#>blasters</a> with these balls</strong>.</p><p>Children loved this toy gun because of&nbsp;how well it&nbsp;was made and how far it&nbsp;could shoot. In&nbsp;2011, Nerf was <a href=#>named</a> the best toy for boys.</p><p><h2>Happy Meal</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/36e/1fc/986df15b1a97aea29f20f3f0ac.jpg><p>These food kits were invented in&nbsp;the <a href=#>’70s</a> of&nbsp;the 20th century. The employees of&nbsp;McDonald’s in&nbsp;Guatemala decided to&nbsp;make the process of&nbsp;eating with children as&nbsp;<a href=#>simple</a> for parents as&nbsp;possible. They decided to&nbsp;create kits for boys and girls. The idea was successful and soon it&nbsp;reached the management in&nbsp;Chicago. Bob Bernstein was <a href=#>responsible</a> for the concept of&nbsp;Happy Meals.</p><p>Once, Bob noticed children looking at&nbsp;boxes of&nbsp;cornflakes and he&nbsp;thought that McDonald’s also needed to&nbsp;have great packaging. <strong>This is&nbsp;where the idea of&nbsp;boxes with fast-food and toys came from</strong> and the best children illustrators worked on&nbsp;the design.</p><p>Obviously, the idea was extremely successful and it&nbsp;won the hearts of&nbsp;little kids.</p><p><h2>Monster High</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0d1/922/98d0c15c71900d774defbbffb9.jpg><p>The gothic appearances of&nbsp;these dolls attract girls like a&nbsp;magnet. Adults are surprised to&nbsp;find out that their daughters like vampires, werewolves, artificial blood, and skulls.</p><p>Garrett Sander <a href=#>had the idea</a> of&nbsp;creating these toys with his twin brother Darren and together they designed the girls whose parents are the monsters from horror films and scary tales.</p><p>Today, the Monster High crew is&nbsp;not just a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;toys. <strong>There are several animated movies, a&nbsp;book series, and even a&nbsp;video game about them</strong>. And in&nbsp;2017, Mattel released <a href=#>Enchantimals</a> that combine the features of&nbsp;people and animals.</p><p><h2>Bonus: “Monopoly” was supposed to&nbsp;change society.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f03/f1d/85628557ecaff8d9642b88ee5c.jpg><p>The story of&nbsp;this product started in&nbsp;1903 when Lizzie Magie <a href=#>created</a> a&nbsp;board game called “The Landlord’s Game.” The inventor was trying to&nbsp;show the growing generation that it&nbsp;was unfair that a&nbsp;small group of&nbsp;businessmen could just own a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;property.</p><p>Lizzie wanted to&nbsp;sell the game to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;customers, so&nbsp;she went to&nbsp;the Parker Brothers with her offer. <strong>They turned it&nbsp;down because they thought the rules were too complicated</strong>. But in&nbsp;1936, Charles Darrow went to&nbsp;the same company with a&nbsp;suspiciously similar idea. His offer was also turned down.</p><p>But Darrow was a&nbsp;persistent man and he&nbsp;released “Monopoly” on&nbsp;his own. When it&nbsp;became popular, the Parker Brothers <a href=#>realized</a> that they had made a&nbsp;mistake and accepted Darrow’s offer. The game was incredibly popular. Today, there are even “Monopoly” <a href=#>competitions</a>. But Lizzie’s original idea was lost: in&nbsp;the modern version, the ultimate goal is&nbsp;to&nbsp;own everything.</p><p>Which toys or&nbsp;devices do&nbsp;your children really love?

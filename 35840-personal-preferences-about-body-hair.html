This view is shared by men and women about equally (55% and 51% respectively). Just 7% of women think hairs on upper lips should not be removed.</p><p data-block-key=qnkz8>Overall, three in ten Britons (30%) say they have no preference on what a woman does with any hair on her upper lip. Younger Britons – those aged 16-24 ­– are especially unlikely to care, at 45% (although there is a large gender divide, with 55% of young women but only 35% of young men taking a neutral view).</p><p data-block-key=kt8as>When it comes to female armpit hair, 59% of Britons consider it unattractive. Again, men and women are about as likely to hold the same view, at 57% and 61% respectively. A third (34%) say it’s neither attractive nor unattractive.</p><p data-block-key=2ra47>Slightly fewer Britons (53%) think women should get rid of their armpit hair - 52% of men and 54% of women respectively. A third (37%) of Britons say they have no preference. Just 6% of men and 5% of women say that women should keep hairs under their arms.</p><p data-block-key=smgjl>When the same question was asked about men, the results were opposite: just 9% of Britons think men should remove their armpit hair (10% of men and 8% of women said this), while four in ten (41%) Britons think men should not.</p><p data-block-key=dwcai>As with upper lip hair, younger Britons are far less bothered than their elders about what women (and men) do with their armpit hair. Half of 16-24-year-olds (50%) are indifferent to what a woman does with her armpits, with 53% saying the same of men. Among older age groups those figures range from 32-37% in the case of female armpit hair, and 41-46% in the case of male armpit hair.</p><h3 data-block-key=mya05>Leg, chest and back hair</h3><p data-block-key=pf464>When it comes to hairy legs, our study shows more Britons find them acceptable on men than on women.</p><p data-block-key=f6c1d>About two-thirds of Britons (64%) - 66% of men and 62% of women - think it’s unattractive for women to have hairy legs. Conversely, just 5% say it’s unattractive for a man to have hairy legs. A quarter (26%) find men’s hairy legs attractive (21% of men and 30% of women said this).</p><p data-block-key=29hf5>Among 16-24-year-old women, 57% – a rate significantly more than any other age/gender group – say hairy legs on women are neither attractive nor unattractive.</p><p data-block-key=cnpmg>A growing trend in male grooming is to have chest and back hair removed.</p><p data-block-key=14nof>But, the YouGov Body Image Study finds that just 9% of Britons think it’s better for men to have no hairs on their chest – 8% of men and 9% of women say this.</p><p data-block-key=h2g9q>A third of Britons (32%) think that men look better with somewhat hairy chests, while 4% think men look best with very hairy chests. Four in ten (40%) British women think men look better with very/somewhat hairy chests. Notably fewer men (31%) share this view.</p><p data-block-key=mlp1l>Over a quarter of Britons (27%) have no opinion on whether men look better with or without hairs on their chests.</p><p data-block-key=5xh9g>Men’s hairy backs are, however, a different matter, with six in ten Britons (62%) finding them unattractive. A fifth (22%) say hairy backs are neither attractive nor unattractive, with more women (27%) than men (17%) saying this.</p><h3 data-block-key=84kuk>Pubic hairstyles</h3><p data-block-key=24qw7>The Body Image Study looked into how much Britons liked particular styles of women’s and men’s pubic hair.</p><p data-block-key=dr0fk>For all Brits, the most well-liked pubic hairstyle for both genders is trimmed: half (52%) like this when it comes to women’s pubic area, and four in ten (40%) when it comes to men’s.</p><p data-block-key=bn79o>Among women themselves, however, the most liked option is the standard bikini line (48%), followed by trimmed (46%) pubic hair. For men, the most liked type of women’s pubic hair is trimmed (59%).</p><p data-block-key=akpa0>Three in ten Britons (32%) like for a woman’s pubic area to be <i>au naturel,</i> with a similar percentage of men and women saying this.</p><p data-block-key=27suy>On the other hand, notably more men (49%) than their female counterparts (23%) like for a woman to have a completely shaved pubic area. Men under 40 are significantly more likely (58%-59%) than men over 40 (37-47%) to say this. The same significant disparency is noted between younger women (41-47%) and older women (8-15%).</p><p data-block-key=b72q9>When it comes to the male pubic area, nearly four in ten men (38%) like neatly trimmed styles, while a quarter (25%) like natural styles. The most disliked male pubic hairstyle among men is shaven – a third (33%) say they don’t like compared to a fifth (22%) who say they do.</p><p data-block-key=q88dh>Among women, four in ten (41%) like the man’s pubic hair area to be trimmed, and a third (35%) like when it’s natural.</p><p data-block-key=enzwu>Significantly more women (59%) than men (46%) aged 25-39 say they like the male pubic area trimmed, which is a big difference compared to men and women across other age groups where the numbers are even.</p><p data-block-key=2ytrx>Half of women (51%) say they dislike it when a man has completely shaved pubic area, with only 14% liking it. It is a more popular style among 16-24-year-old women, however, with only 27% disliking it. One in three women this age (31%) like a hairless gentleman’s area, and another 33% don’t mind.</p><p data-block-key=dd7lr>This article is part of a wider study conducted by YouGov:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtktaaty62faJmiqbakuMSsZmxtaGl9brzEq6qoppGherG%2BxJ%2Bcq52emLK0ecCbpq6sXZe8pcWMoZiiqg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./6667-raunchy-renault-ad-banned-watchdog.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Raunchy Renault ad banned by watchdog</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./paris-hilton.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Paris Hilton</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

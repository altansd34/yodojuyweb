He&nbsp;was 47&nbsp;and&nbsp;I was 32. I&nbsp;have two kids, 20&nbsp;and 18&nbsp;now. Both are away at&nbsp;college.</p><p>Trudi never liked&nbsp;me, and that was fine. She has a&nbsp;mother, and she was a&nbsp;full adult living on&nbsp;her own when we&nbsp;met. Her parents had been divorced for six years when&nbsp;I met her father.</p><p>We&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;city with lots of&nbsp;tourism, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;was an&nbsp;easy decision to&nbsp;keep my&nbsp;apartment and do&nbsp;short-term rentals when my&nbsp;kids and&nbsp;I moved in&nbsp;with my&nbsp;husband. We&nbsp;also use it&nbsp;for out-of-town guests.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d72/66f/4527b75176bd82b42169046a2c.jpg><p>Trudi and her husband ran into some financial problems last year. Trudi and her <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> of&nbsp;four moved in&nbsp;with&nbsp;us. We&nbsp;agreed that after the holidays, I&nbsp;would stop taking reservations for my&nbsp;apartment, and they could move in&nbsp;there. They would sign a&nbsp;lease, and we&nbsp;would «rent» it&nbsp;to&nbsp;them without collecting rent so&nbsp;they could build up&nbsp;rental history and money.</p><p>Trudi moved in&nbsp;last October. It&nbsp;was hell. She doesn’t help around the house, and neither do&nbsp;her kids. Her husband is&nbsp;working hard to&nbsp;get money together for them, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;comes home exhausted. And he&nbsp;is&nbsp;more help than her or&nbsp;their kids.</p><p>The three of&nbsp;them leave dirty dishes everywhere. Dirty laundry everywhere. The house is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;mess. I&nbsp;have spoken to&nbsp;all of&nbsp;them, including my&nbsp;husband, about this. My&nbsp;son-in-law is&nbsp;the only one who makes an&nbsp;effort. Trudi said that&nbsp;I live in&nbsp;her father’s house, so&nbsp;I don’t get to&nbsp;tell her what to&nbsp;do. My&nbsp;husband did not back me&nbsp;up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1ac/0f4/58e6285b0ab764535962245abd.jpg><p>So&nbsp;I&nbsp;moved out. My&nbsp;apartment is&nbsp;now empty since the holidays are over. I&nbsp;said&nbsp;I didn’t want them treating my&nbsp;property like they were treating my&nbsp;husband’s home.</p><p>They are all mad at&nbsp;me&nbsp;for leaving and changing the plan. She threatened to&nbsp;sue me&nbsp;since they have a&nbsp;signed lease. I&nbsp;told her to&nbsp;go&nbsp;ahead since&nbsp;I could prove that&nbsp;I never got the agreed-upon deposit or&nbsp;the first and last month’s rent (which we&nbsp;were going to&nbsp;«cover» to&nbsp;help them start over).</p><p>I’ve been here for a&nbsp;week now and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;great. No&nbsp;noise, no&nbsp;mess, and a&nbsp;much better commute for me&nbsp;to&nbsp;my&nbsp;work. My&nbsp;husband has been spending a&nbsp;few nights a&nbsp;week here with&nbsp;me. He&nbsp;wants me&nbsp;to&nbsp;come home and give them the apartment like we&nbsp;agreed. I&nbsp;said&nbsp;I would do&nbsp;that if&nbsp;we&nbsp;went back to&nbsp;his house that minute, and it&nbsp;was in&nbsp;good shape.</p><p>The narrator’s voiceover goes here, «It&nbsp;was not.» It&nbsp;was disgusting like it&nbsp;smelled bad. It&nbsp;was as&nbsp;if&nbsp;five teenage boys were living there with no&nbsp;supervision.</p><p>She saw me&nbsp;looking around in&nbsp;disgust and said that it&nbsp;wasn’t her fault and that the mess was because they didn’t have their own living space. Yeah, sure. I&nbsp;turned around and went back to&nbsp;my&nbsp;place.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f13/16c/34628759d5b8dc28fb061e2c54.jpg><p>I&nbsp;offered to&nbsp;let my&nbsp;husband move in&nbsp;with me&nbsp;if&nbsp;he&nbsp;wanted them to&nbsp;have their own space. He&nbsp;won’t because he&nbsp;is&nbsp;retired and likes where he&nbsp;is.</p><p>So&nbsp;like I&nbsp;said, they are all mad at&nbsp;me. My&nbsp;husband, Trudi, and her kids. Trudi’s husband is&nbsp;the only one who understands my&nbsp;position. I&nbsp;will no&nbsp;longer agree to&nbsp;let them in&nbsp;my&nbsp;apartment and&nbsp;I will also only move back once they leave.</p><p><h2>Others on&nbsp;Reddit supported her.</h2></p><ul><li>’’If it’s HIS house then this is&nbsp;his problem.

However, some procedures that are offered in nail <a href=# title=salons data-link=tag>salons</a>, as well as mistakes in care, can lead to the opposite effect. We decided to put together the <a href=# title=tips data-link=tag>tips</a> that will make your toenails not only beautiful, but also healthy.</p><p><h2>It’s better to&nbsp;file your toenails instead of&nbsp;clipping them.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/509/3a0/2c9ee75387b02e1233fd635e9d.jpg><p>Some experts <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>advise</a> clipping toenails with the help of manicure scissors or nail clippers. However, not everyone is able to clip the nail plates with these tools properly, and some ladies <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tend</a> to shorten their nails too much, which can <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lead</a> to ingrown nails.</p><p>It's better to <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>file</a> nails, because it's easier to adjust their length this way. In addition, this method helps to avoid sharp edges on the nails, which cling to socks and tear tights. The main thing is to file the nails in one direction and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>use</a> a glass tool with a <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hardness</a> of 180 grit. Women also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>note</a> that after they started using a nail file, their toenails began to break less often.</p><p><h2>You don't need to trim cuticles.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/60e/bd2/fc92e852cd984bd1e5c4c56c2f.jpg><p>Although toenails with trimmed cuticle and eponychium (the skin at the base of the nail plate) do <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>look</a> better, you should not trim these areas with scissors or other tools. These tissues <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>protect</a> your nails from <a href=# title=bacteria data-link=tag>bacteria</a> and fungus, and if you constantly trim them, you can get an infection.</p><p><h2>Don't shave your legs before a pedicure.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/180/de8/a74cf35c138b3e7859a849a95a.jpg><p>It's not the best idea to <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shave</a> your legs within 48 hours before your salon visit. Shaving can <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>leave</a> microscopic cuts on the skin, and the chance of dangerous bacteria entering the body during a pedicure bath increases. This can lead to boils and infections that are difficult to treat.</p><p><h2>Don't use fish pedicure.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aca/21c/f8e5f05db69b5aff80daa14a10.jpg><p>Some salons <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>offer</a> this exotic procedure as an alternative to conventional foot exfoliation. During the session, the fish gently pinch the skin, gently peeling away dead skin cells and calluses. However, this procedure is not as safe as many people think. Salon employees are simply not able to properly sterilize the pool between clients. And the fish may spread infections themselves.</p><p><h2>Remove nail polish in time.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/51a/64b/acfdd351da86b16293dd2be803.jpg><p>In addition, you <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>should</a> not wear a pedicure for longer than 2–3 weeks. Nail plates perfectly absorb any substances, so the chemical elements inside the <a href=# title="nail polish" data-link=tag>nail polish</a>, over time, penetrate the nails and destroy them. After removing the nail polish, it's worth giving your nails a couple of weeks to rest. Otherwise, they will quickly become dry and brittle.</p><p><h2>You can remove nail polish marks on&nbsp;your toes without nail polish remover.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a92/a79/d328f459ae8287f9018b387aac.jpg><p>If after applying nail polish, your nails don't look as neat as you want, don't remove the smudges on your skin with cotton discs or q-tips soaked in nail polish remover. This way, you can ruin the pedicure, and you will have to do it all over again.</p><p>It's worth waiting until the polish dries completely (usually it takes about an hour), and then apply moisturizing cream to the foot and put on socks. After that, just walk around the house for about 60 minutes. Moisturizer is great at removing polish from the skin, but leaves it on the nails. In the end, you will just need to wipe the cream and polish residue off your skin.</p><p><h2>Skip the jet spray tub pedicure.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d5c/545/bff83c551999a3ed891eadef4b.jpg><p>Many women <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>like</a> to have a pedicure at a salon because they can relax while their feet soak in a tub of warm water. After each use, this container must be <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sterilized</a>, otherwise pathogenic bacteria quickly multiply there.</p><p>However, not all bathtubs can be completely cleaned of harmful microorganisms. Thus, jet spray tubs, in which the water is constantly circulating, almost impossible to disinfect. As a result, the chances of catching a fungus or other unpleasant things during this procedure increase.</p><p><h2>Don't keep your feet in the water for too long.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d5e/97f/86cab55bf1ac28bd1f98511f57.jpg><p>Ideally, the feet should be in a warm water bath for no more than 10 to 15 minutes. If you enjoy this treatment for too long, the skin will become too soft, which increases the risk of catching fungus. In addition, toenails that have <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>absorbed</a> too much moisture become brittle. As a result, the pedicure itself will become a real challenge, and a nail tech may inadvertently <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cause</a> injury.</p><p><h2>It's best not to use self-tanner or sunbathe after a pedicure.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/44e/a8c/f1a9525f3fa4a7b103835f65e1.jpg><p>Many women <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>prefer</a> a gel pedicure because it lasts longer and dries faster. Therefore, it's especially frustrating when after a few days the coating suddenly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>changes</a> color or turns yellow. There are several factors that can affect this process. For example, the coating is sensitive to ultraviolet light, so long exposure to the sun or the use of self-tanner can irreparably ruin the pedicure.</p><p><h2>It’s worth trying a&nbsp;dry pedicure.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/12b/636/ced04b546bbe22d69dfe542905.jpg><p>As the name implies, this method does not <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>use</a> water, and the focus is on nail care. The dry pedicure has several advantages. First, the procedure takes less time. And second, the risk of catching fungus or infection is much less, as clients don't need to use pedicure baths.</p><p>In addition, the dry pedicure helps to preserve the natural balance of fluid in the nails, and the coating itself lasts longer.</p><p><h2>You should pay attention to what kind of nail polish is used in the salon.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c86/d6e/2009445eb592c024bc0293cb7a.jpg><p>Some nail polishes <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>used</a> by salon technicians may contain hazardous chemicals. These include formaldehyde, toluene and dibutyl phthalate. Therefore, it's worth paying attention to the label and look for such words as "3-free" or "5-free." These coatings are much healthier for your nails.</p><p>It's better to <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bring</a> your own base coat and nail polish. The fact is that most products don't kill all bacteria and fungal spores, and even a simple application of nail polish can ruin your nails.</p><p>Also, don't <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>use</a> coatings that contain substances designed to strengthen the nails. As a result, the nail plates will become stiffer and, surprisingly, will break more often.</p><p>And here are some <a href=#>ideas</a> for summer pedicure design.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5yedKemqudpKh6oq7OrqtmqJWZtqTB0Z6qZrGfqr9uusCio2aslZi1bsPIpaNmqKKkr6Kuy7Jkp52mmr9uwMSlo2axn6p6oq7OrqtmcGFuhniDjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./14-makeup-lovers-who-tried-to-recreate-famous-looks-and-left-us-in-awe-806748.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>14 Makeup Lovers Who Tried to Recreate Famous Looks and Left Us in Awe</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./american-idol-laine-laci-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Idol's Katy Perry Speculates Laine &amp;amp; Laci Are Dating, But Here's The Truth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;15, Reeves <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>asked</a> his mother, Patricia Taylor, if&nbsp;it&nbsp;was okay for him to&nbsp;pursue acting, and she gave him her blessing. “Whatever you want, dear,” she said. Reeves then wasted no&nbsp;time and enrolled in&nbsp;an&nbsp;acting class to&nbsp;study the field.</p><p>Although he&nbsp;acknowledged that his mother couldn’t have stopped him, Reeves expressed gratitude for her support.

She has designed costumes for renowned musicians, such as&nbsp;<a href=# title="David Bowie" data-link=tag>David Bowie</a>, Emmylou Harris, and Alice Cooper.

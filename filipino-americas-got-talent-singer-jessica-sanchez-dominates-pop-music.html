Before she was belting out classic ballads on the FOX show, she auditioned for America’s Got Talent. Jessica really set the standard for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">incredible Filipino performers</a> on talent shows and showed off her captivating voice to the world. What has she been up to since finding talent show fame?&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jessica-sanchez-battled-for-the-wildcard-on-season-1-of-america-s-got-talent>Jessica Sanchez Battled For the Wildcard on Season 1 of ‘America’s Got Talent’</h2><p>Jessica was born and raised in Chula Vista, California by a Filipino mom and a Mexican-American dad. She started singing when she was 2 years old, taking inspiration from musicians like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mariah Carey</a>, Etta James, and Ray Charles.&nbsp;The youngster <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">took any opportunity she could</a> to sing in front of other people at birthday parties or in front of her grandmother’s friends. She was really shy and would stare at the floor the whole time.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><p>Eventually, she was able to overcome her shyness.&nbsp;When she was 10, Jessica performed Aretha Franklin’s “Respect” on an episode of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showtime at the Apollo</a>. She competed on the very first season of America’s Got Talent the following year. Jessica was the only contestant chosen for a wildcard slot whose audition did not air on television.&nbsp;</p><p>Judge Brandy knew Jessica was a star on the rise and wanted America to hear her sing. At the time of her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wildcard performance</a>, Jessica’s father was serving in the US Navy and was deployed to Iraq. She wanted to make both her dad and Brandy proud with her performance of “I Surrender.”</p><p>Though she did not advance in the competition, Jessica took her success from AGT and began performing on stages everywhere. She released a few covers through an independent record label including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Don’t Stop the Music”</a> by Rihanna for Spin Move Records.&nbsp;In 2010, Jessica was one of the singers who participated in a YouTube edition of the charity single <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“We Are the World 25 for Haiti.”</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-grew-her-fanbase-even-more-on-american-idol>She Grew Her Fanbase Even More on ‘American Idol’</h2><p>Jessica really found her claim to fame on Season 11 of American Idol. It was her cover of Whitney Houston’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“I Will Always Love You”</a> that turned her into a global phenomenon.&nbsp;Jessica received one of the longest standing ovations in American Idol history and the judges jumped up and down in awe after her performance. She was labeled as the frontrunner.</p><p>She was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">saved from elimination</a> by the judges after shockingly receiving the lowest number of votes in the Top 7. The judges jumped on stage while she was singing to tell her she would be saved. It was one of the most dramatic American Idol moments in history. The 16-year-old <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>made it to the final two</a> and fans thought she was going to win. It was Phillip Phillips who took home the prize that season.</p><p>Jessica landed a deal with Interscope Records shortly after competing and the world waited to see what she was going to do next.&nbsp;She took her talents to the small screen portraying the role of Frida Romero on the hit Fox show Glee. Her performance of the “Clarity” was so good that she got to perform it with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Zedd</a> on YouTube.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Jessica released her debut album, Me,&nbsp;You&nbsp;& the&nbsp;Music in 2013. It includes the hit <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Tonight”</a> with Ne-Yo which has over 23.5 million views on YouTube.&nbsp;She performed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Feel This Moment”</a> by Pitbull and Christina Aguilera during Season 16 of Dancing with the Stars. She also took a trip to Macau, China in 2013 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to sing both the Filipino and United States national anthems</a> at one of Manny Pacquiao’s fights.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jessica-continues-to-use-her-platform-for-charity-and-important-causes>Jessica Continues to Use Her Platform For Charity and Important Causes</h2><p>Jessica performed at the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pinoy Relief Benefit Concert</a> where all proceeds were donated to the Filipino citizens that were affected by Typhoon Haiyan. She parted ways with Interscope in 2014 due to her album underperforming. Jessica traveled back and forth to the Philippines for performances, not letting anything stop her.</p><p>In 2016, she released the single called “Stronger Together.” It became the campaign song for Hilary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention in 2016. She was then brought back to sing “The Prayer” at the American Idol series finale on Fox.&nbsp;Even though the night was supposed to be about Trent Harmon and the end of an era, Twitter could only focus on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jessica’s stunning performance</a>.</p><p>Jessica has always found time to give back to the Philippines. She took a trip with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Starkey Hearing Foundation</a> to give out free hearing aids to those in need. During the pandemic, Jessica did take a little break from music. She decided to write the anti-racism anthem, “Us” to speak to the discrimination Asians are currently facing in America.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Jessica also spoke in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recent interview</a> about songwriting and releasing singles that will eventually lead up to a new EP. In July, she began <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">posting song covers</a> of some of the most popular hits by modern artists including Ariana Grande and Dua Lipa. Her fans absolutely cannot wait to see what she decides to do next.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1322226975.jpg alt="Zhavia Teases New Album After Years of Successful Song Releases" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xaKjoqiZo7xurcyeqaKbkah6qLvTZquapJWjwW6%2FyKeenqpdn7K0v8icmGarkaOwqbHZZpuopZmjrrWx0manqKhdosK0tcJo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./forbes-magazine.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Forbes Magazine popularity &amp;amp; fame</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dwayne-johnson-is-unrecognizable-with-new-dark-hair-the-look-left-people-in-shock-819125.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dwayne Johnson Is Unrecognizable With New Dark Hair The Look Left People in Shock</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

She loves her a&nbsp;lot, but there’s one thing that adds a&nbsp;grain of&nbsp;salt to&nbsp;their ideal relationship. The woman revealed that her girlfriend has a&nbsp;very poor hygiene, and she initiated a&nbsp;talk about this already. But the reaction of&nbsp;her partner is&nbsp;quite weird, and the woman wants to&nbsp;know what she’s doing wrong in&nbsp;this case and what other people would do&nbsp;on&nbsp;her place.</p><p><h2>The woman noticed the strange behavior of&nbsp;her gf&nbsp;on&nbsp;the first date.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/392/c2f/cddfc252deb500db88088cb75f.jpg><p>A&nbsp;woman has spoken about a&nbsp;problem that occurred in&nbsp;her nearly ideal relationship. She posted on&nbsp;one of&nbsp;Reddit’s communities and asked people for advice. She started her post, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, «I&nbsp;don’t think I’m in&nbsp;the wrong here, but maybe I’m being unreasonable, I&nbsp;don’t know.»</p><p>She then told people the backstory of&nbsp;the conflict. She wrote, «I&nbsp;24F have been with my&nbsp;gf&nbsp;22F for about 2&nbsp;years now. She’s wonderful and&nbsp;I love her a&nbsp;lot. On&nbsp;our very first date, something&nbsp;I noticed was that she didn’t seem very concerned with cleanliness.»</p><p>The woman thought the first red flag was when they had a&nbsp;snack together. She explained, «We&nbsp;ended our date by&nbsp;grabbing a&nbsp;snack that she wanted&nbsp;us to&nbsp;bring back to&nbsp;her place. We&nbsp;got there, and she immediately started taking everything out without washing her hands.»</p><p><h2>The woman thinks this habit is&nbsp;ruining their relationship.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b3/3f4/47bb5f585e9369beea4d2c3e94.jpg><p>The OP&nbsp;explains that she couldn’t accept this without noticing.</p><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, «Maybe I’m just a&nbsp;clean freak, but this surprised me&nbsp;a&nbsp;little. I&nbsp;brushed it&nbsp;off until she excitedly tried to&nbsp;get me&nbsp;to&nbsp;try some charcuterie jelly she had. She did this by&nbsp;dipping her finger directly into the jar and holding it&nbsp;out for me&nbsp;to&nbsp;try.»</p><p>This mess made the woman really sick. She wrote, «At&nbsp;this point&nbsp;I felt pretty icky about it&nbsp;and jokingly said something like „and get a&nbsp;taste of&nbsp;all that stuff we&nbsp;were touching earlier?“ (We&nbsp;were out and about, public transit, etc.). She seemed a&nbsp;little embarrassed but agreed that was a&nbsp;little gross, but still didn’t wash her hands. This was the first day we&nbsp;knew each other.»</p><p><h2>Things are already getting too far in&nbsp;their duo.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5b7/092/ef145f51598909e6623e3495f1.jpg><p>The woman goes on&nbsp;with her story, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, «To&nbsp;this day, I&nbsp;have not witnessed her wash her hands with anything more than water. And even that takes me&nbsp;asking multiple times. She will go&nbsp;about her whole day, use the washroom, etc. without washing her hands.» The desperate&nbsp;OP can’t stand this habit anymore. She notices the absence of&nbsp;elementary hygiene rules everywhere in&nbsp;their life.</p><p>She wrote, «She loves finding „treasures“ when we’re walking around, like abandoned <a href=# title=toys data-link=tag>toys</a>, household stuff, <a href=# title=clothes data-link=tag>clothes</a>, etc. even if&nbsp;they are visibly very dirty. She touches everything and anything, doesn’t wash her hands. She also showers maybe twice a&nbsp;week, doesn’t use soap there either. The ONLY time she washes her hair or&nbsp;uses soap to&nbsp;clean her body is&nbsp;when&nbsp;I literally do&nbsp;it&nbsp;for her, which she says she enjoys.»</p><p>The woman is&nbsp;concerned about her and her partner’s <a href=# title=health data-link=tag>health</a>. She explained, «This wouldn’t bother me&nbsp;so&nbsp;much if&nbsp;it&nbsp;weren’t for a&nbsp;few things: she likes to&nbsp;cook for&nbsp;me, she loves to&nbsp;dip her fingers into jars and drink straight from bottles instead of&nbsp;using silverware and cups, she touches my&nbsp;face a&nbsp;lot, and to&nbsp;be&nbsp;honest, she stinks. And onto my&nbsp;main point, she is&nbsp;ALWAYS sick.»</p><p><h2>Her partner’s reaction to&nbsp;hygiene talks is&nbsp;also quite bizarre.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cda/cc6/9e05ca59069a1a40dfec91e27a.jpg><p>The woman <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a>, «She tends to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very sensitive and gets very upset if&nbsp;she thinks that I’m implying that she’s gross in&nbsp;any way, so&nbsp;I try to&nbsp;be&nbsp;as&nbsp;gentle as&nbsp;possible when encouraging her to&nbsp;wash herself. Eventually, I&nbsp;guess&nbsp;I got fed up&nbsp;when she was complaining about being sick again, and said that maybe the reason she keeps getting colds and other illnesses is&nbsp;because her hygiene isn’t very good.»</p><p>And the reaction was very strange. The OP&nbsp;described&nbsp;it, saying, «She got really quiet, cried a&nbsp;bit, and now she thinks that&nbsp;I think she is&nbsp;disgusting and cries whenever&nbsp;I bring up&nbsp;washing hands or&nbsp;anything like that. She used to&nbsp;just laugh and brush it&nbsp;off, but now she seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;really upset by&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;don’t know what else to&nbsp;do, and&nbsp;I feel like a&nbsp;bad person. But I&nbsp;don’t think&nbsp;I did anything wrong, either.»</p><p><h2>Reddit people delivered their opinions in&nbsp;the comments.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/14d/617/39020f520ba7e25b2a06cde712.jpg><p>The users mainly supported the woman and gave her some of&nbsp;their opinions. One person <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, «She will only use soap when you wash her body and her hair for her? That’s a&nbsp;big problem and is&nbsp;unacceptable. At&nbsp;her age, she should know what proper hygiene&nbsp;is.»</p><p>Another person <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>added</a>, «There are some cases when it’s better to&nbsp;be&nbsp;gentle with someone, and others when it’s necessary to&nbsp;be&nbsp;firm and uncompromising. Hygiene is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;those. OP, you need to&nbsp;sit her down and tell her point-blank that her hygiene is&nbsp;not good enough.<br>If&nbsp;she gets upset („you’re calling me&nbsp;gross!“), don’t rise up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the argument. Stay calm, and keep telling her to&nbsp;listen. Keep listing the issues (the handwashing, the showering, maybe food prep, etc.). Tell her that her health issues can be&nbsp;directly related to&nbsp;her hygiene issues. Tell her what you expect from her and why, and what consequences you’d enforce if&nbsp;she doesn’t follow suit.»</p><p>Another user <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, «I&nbsp;have debilitating depression. My&nbsp;hygiene can, at&nbsp;times, become non-existent. I&nbsp;would say it’s either that or&nbsp;she just has never ever been shown how to&nbsp;clean herself. Which is&nbsp;still pretty weird.»</p><p>And here’s yet another story from a&nbsp;woman, who also has something to&nbsp;tell her partner. He&nbsp;insisted on&nbsp;them having a&nbsp;<a href=#>paternity test</a> for their kid, and she has something in&nbsp;her mind for when the results come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6ecaiqaWeop6yr7CMoZisZZFiw6a%2B2GanqKeiYrW6s8iepZ5lmWLBsLjDZp%2Beql2Wr7DB02agrWWRo7FutMSrZKudkZjBqrvNZqCsZZKex6K%2B0Z5kcWlnboB1ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./niall-horan-to-release-the-show-deluxe-version-featuring-john-legend-lizzy-mcalpine.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Niall Horan to Release 'The Show' Deluxe Version Featuring John Legend, Lizzy McAlpine</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./6347-messi-backlash-twitter.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Messi backlash on Twitter | YouGov</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

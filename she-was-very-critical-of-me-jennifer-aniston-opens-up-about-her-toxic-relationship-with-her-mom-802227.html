She has been nominated and won numerous awards, and she’s appeared on&nbsp;the lists of&nbsp;the most popular, prosperous, and attractive women. And her role as&nbsp;Rachel Green on&nbsp;the iconic&nbsp;TV show <a href=#><i>Friends</i></a> <a href=#>is</a>&nbsp;considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the greatest television characters of&nbsp;all time. Hence, it&nbsp;may be&nbsp;a&nbsp;hard-to-believe fact that behind such a&nbsp;successful career and public life stands a&nbsp;complicated childhood story that Jennifer wasn’t ready to&nbsp;share until recently.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> want to&nbsp;share the story of&nbsp;Jennifer Aniston’s relationship with her mother, and how it&nbsp;affected her life, with our readers.</p><p><h2>Jennifer’s mother was nearly perfect and wanted her daughter to&nbsp;also be&nbsp;perfect.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/02a/b23/0928915640bc9822ba0b37850f.jpg><p>Jennifer’s mom, Nancy Dow, <a href=#>was</a> an&nbsp;<a href=# title=actress data-link=tag>actress</a> and model. She starred in&nbsp;many shows, including <a href=#><i>The Beverly Hillbillies</i></a> and the iconic <a href=#><i>The Wild Wild West</i></a>. Dow’s occupation strongly influenced the way she raised her daughter. “She was from this world&nbsp;of, ’Honey, take better care of&nbsp;yourself,’ or ’Honey, put your face on,’ or&nbsp;all of&nbsp;those odd sound bites that&nbsp;I can remember from my&nbsp;childhood,” <a href=#>remembers</a> Aniston. Nancy was trying to&nbsp;make her daughter perfect:</p><p>“She was very critical of&nbsp;me. Because she was a&nbsp;model, she was gorgeous, stunning. I&nbsp;wasn’t. I&nbsp;never was,” <a href=#>says</a> Jennifer.</p><p><h2>Nancy provoked the toxic relationship with her daughter.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/076/3ae/f0a3825513bdf2ad9979e2ca1d.jpg><p>After her parents split&nbsp;up, Jennifer was left with her mother. The relationship worsened as&nbsp;Nancy tended to&nbsp;neglect her daughter’s <a href=# title=emotions data-link=tag>emotions</a>. “I&nbsp;was never taught that&nbsp;I could scream,” <a href=#>says</a> Aniston. “One time, I&nbsp;raised my&nbsp;voice to&nbsp;my&nbsp;mother, and&nbsp;I screamed at&nbsp;her, and she looked at&nbsp;me&nbsp;and burst out laughing. She was laughing at&nbsp;me [for] screaming back. And it&nbsp;was like a&nbsp;punch in&nbsp;my&nbsp;stomach.”</p><p>In&nbsp;1999 Nancy published a&nbsp;book called <a href=#><i>From Mother and Daughter to&nbsp;Friends: A&nbsp;Memoir</i></a>. The publication hurt Jennifer so&nbsp;severely that she <a href=#>did not</a> speak to&nbsp;her mother for many years. She did not even invite Dow to&nbsp;her and <a href=# title="Brad Pitt" data-link=tag>Brad Pitt</a>’s wedding. Their relationship was completely ruined.</p><p><h2>Mother and daughter didn’t reunite until many years afterward.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0d9/49a/d2d65854d387547e9cbfc5f116.jpg><p>After Jennifer got <a href=# title=divorced data-link=tag>divorced</a>, she and Nancy started re-building their relationship. Speaking about their reunion, Jennifer <a href=#>said</a>, “It’s been really nice. It’s crazy what, you know, your life <a href=# title=kind data-link=tag>kind</a> of&nbsp;being turned upside down will lead you&nbsp;to. For&nbsp;us it&nbsp;was the time, and it&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;happen when it&nbsp;was supposed to&nbsp;happen. So&nbsp;this is&nbsp;good. It’s baby steps.”</p><p><h2>Jennifer accepts everything that happened.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/36a/eb4/dc7b0b5f729f90d26a6b940225.jpg><p>Nancy <a href=#>died</a> in&nbsp;2016. Later&nbsp;on, in&nbsp;2018, remembering her mother, Jennifer admitted that, despite being harsh, her mother always only wanted the best for her. “My&nbsp;mom said those things because she really loved&nbsp;me,” <a href=#>said</a> Aniston. “It&nbsp;wasn’t her trying to&nbsp;be [bad] or&nbsp;knowing she would be&nbsp;making some deep wounds that&nbsp;I would then spend a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;money to&nbsp;undo. She did it&nbsp;because that was what she grew up&nbsp;with.”</p><p>“I&nbsp;think she was just holding on&nbsp;and doing the best she could.”</p><p><h2>Now, Jennifer is&nbsp;rebuilding her relationship with her father.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7ef/10b/d786535d0285a89ec5d5025037.jpg><p>The shared loss united Jennifer with her father, TV&nbsp;actor John Aniston. Throughout their lives, this father and daughter’s relationship was not smooth either. Jennifer had a&nbsp;hard time going through her parent’s divorce. She and her father didn’t see each other for a&nbsp;year after the divorce. Then, he&nbsp;got in&nbsp;touch with her. “He&nbsp;just called one day and said, “Let’s go&nbsp;see <a href=#><i>The Fantasticks</i></a><i>,</i>” <a href=#>remembers</a> Jennifer. “So&nbsp;we&nbsp;had a&nbsp;little dinner and saw the show.”</p><p>Now, Jennifer and John have <a href=#>reconciled.</a> They keep in&nbsp;touch, they call each other, and Jennifer <a href=#>posts</a> touching archive pictures with John, saying, “Love you, papa.”</p><p>Did you know Jennifer’s not-so-bright childhood story? Or&nbsp;did you just know her for her career achievements?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMCpsYywmKxlppq%2FunnCq6CtoZOWuW67xWaknmWamruvtcWeqWaZnp7AtbvNZqapnZ6oera8jJqZqK2kYrWmvoytprGhk2K%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF51qKroWWYmr9uuc6mZHFoYmd%2FeHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./people.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tanya Abraham | YouGov</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./scottish-phrases-thatll-get-you-through-life.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Scottish Phrases That'll Get You Through Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

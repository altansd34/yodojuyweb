The dance-filled night featured various styles and several live performances by ’90’s legends.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Pairs Gave Their All This Week</h2><p>Since the next episode is the Semi Final, pairs knew tonight was the night to impress. Various pairs returned to the ballroom with their A game for the episode. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wayne Brady</a> and Witney Carson were one of those pairs. They earned yet another perfect score with their Salsa to “Motownphilly” by Boyz II Men. It seems like this pair had a few off nights, but tonight was definitely not one of them.</p><p>Another outstanding pair was Daniel Durant and Britt Stewart. They were completely in sync during their “Enjoy the Silence” by Depeche Mode Jazz routine. What really perfected this dance was the pair’s ability to bring the audience into Daniel’s world, since the song cuts out part way through. It was as if we were all able to live in Daniel’s world for a moment. The judges loved this dance, the pair earned 39 out of 40 points.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Newly single Gabby Windey</a> returned to the ballroom with a Samba to “Livin’ La Vida Loca” by Ricky Martin. This dance was so sensual that Bruno Tonioli called it a “sex bomb!” They earned a perfect score with this dance.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-some-relay-dances-were-predictable-others-not-so-much>Some Relay Dances Were Predictable… Others Not so Much</h2><p>The competition got even tighter when it came to relay dances this week, since the lowest scoring couples on the leaderboard were set to get eliminated. The first battle of the night was Shangela and Gleb versus Daniel and Britt. Each pair performed a Cha Cha Cha to Vanilla Ice’s “Ice Ice Baby.” Even though both couples danced flawlessly, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Len Goodman</a> decided that Shangela won the relay dance.</p><p>Up next was Vinny and KoKo versus Trevor and Emma. These pairs danced the Samba to “My Lovin’ (You’re Never Gonna Get It)” by En Vogue. I thought there was a clear winner between the two pairs, but Carrie Ann Inaba said they were neck and neck. She picked Trevor and Emma as the relay winner.</p><p>Later, Heidi and Artem performed the Samba against Wayne and Witney to “Shoop” by Salt-N-Pepa. Once again, I felt there was a clear winner between the two, but Tonioli thought the couples were neck to neck. In the end, the judge gave the bonus points to Wayne and Witney.</p><p>Finally, Charli and Mark danced the Salsa against Gabby and Val to “Ain’t Gonna Hurt Nobody” by Kid ‘N Play. This was definitely the tightest relay of the competition, since both pairs are typically on top of the leaderboard. In the end, Derek Hough awarded Charli and Mark with five extra points.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>At the end of the episode, the bottom three pairs were Trevor and Emma, Vinny and KoKo, and Heidi and Artem. The lowest combined score and fan vote was Heidi and Artem. The other couple eliminated was Vinny and KoKo.</p><p>Dancing With the Stars returns to Disney+ on November 14 for the Semi Finals. Next weeks episode will feature yet another double elimination. Be sure to tune in on Monday at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/The-Voice-Knockout-Team-Gwen.jpg alt="‘The Voice’ Recap: Knockouts Wrap Up as John Legend Uses His Steal" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dancing with the stars</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>DWTS</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w7CrrGWimrCivIycpqaolam2tbXOp2SgnaSoerW71KCfZq%2BZqbVuvsSlmLJllJa7pLHSZpuorZKhsm6xy6KkoqaRqbawuoyopWZxYKh6r7XGoato</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1590676-davido-chioma-enjoy-splendid-boat-cruise-jamaica-video-leaves-gushing-jaye-lo.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Davido and Chioma Enjoy Splendid Boat Cruise in Jamaica, Video Leaves Many Gushing: Jaye Lo</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./start-innovation.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Coaltown Coffee | Artisan Coffee For The Community</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

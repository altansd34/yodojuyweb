Thick fog descends on&nbsp;it&nbsp;in&nbsp;ominous silence. Then, it’s suddenly broken by&nbsp;the creaking of&nbsp;wooden boards, followed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;rippling of&nbsp;the waves.</p><p>Through the fog, you see the outline of&nbsp;an&nbsp;old large ship. Its hull is&nbsp;rusty, and a&nbsp;strange cold is&nbsp;coming from&nbsp;it... But the most unsettling thing is&nbsp;that there’s no&nbsp;one on&nbsp;the deck.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/34c/8e4/b0e7d351d6bd713d7fa071c64a.jpeg><p>The ship sails without a&nbsp;crew. No, this isn’t a&nbsp;mythical “Flying Dutchman”, but a&nbsp;very real ghost ship. <strong>September&nbsp;2</strong>, <strong>2019</strong>, the British Royal Navy’s Ice Patrol ship called the HMS Protector sails through the calm waters of&nbsp;the Atlantic Ocean. The time is&nbsp;11&nbsp;PM. Some of&nbsp;the ship’s crew are on&nbsp;deck, while others are sleeping in&nbsp;their cabins. The captain steers the ship and looks straight at&nbsp;the horizon.</p><p>The sky is&nbsp;lit up&nbsp;by&nbsp;an&nbsp;orange twilight, and clouds float in&nbsp;the distance. Suddenly, against this beautiful landscape, one of&nbsp;the sailors notices the black silhouette of&nbsp;an&nbsp;unknown ship. The captain slows down and steers the ship a&nbsp;little closer to&nbsp;the mysterious vessel. This is&nbsp;an&nbsp;old cargo ship <strong>250 [ft&nbsp;(75&nbsp;m)] </strong>feet long.</p><p>Attempts to&nbsp;contact the crew members lead to&nbsp;nothing. It&nbsp;seems the unknown boat is&nbsp;floating in&nbsp;the ocean by&nbsp;itself. There’s no&nbsp;one on&nbsp;board. At&nbsp;least no&nbsp;one is&nbsp;alive. The deck of&nbsp;the ship creaks from rocking on&nbsp;the waves. The sun sinks below the horizon and it&nbsp;gets dark. The ship looks terrifying. British sailors don’t dare to&nbsp;climb on&nbsp;that strange deck.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/e99/e94/68c82352b0b435a9edca39f593.jpeg><p>They take a&nbsp;photo, post it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the Internet, and sail away. “<strong>It&nbsp;seems our sailors met a&nbsp;real ghost ship!” “Yeah! I&nbsp;already know.” </strong>Many people on&nbsp;the Internet will assume the sailors met a&nbsp;real ghost ship.&nbsp;5&nbsp;months later, we’re in&nbsp;the village of&nbsp;<strong>Ballycotton</strong> in&nbsp;County Cork, <a href=# title=Ireland data-link=tag>Ireland</a>. A&nbsp;local leaves the house early in&nbsp;the morning to&nbsp;go&nbsp;for a&nbsp;daily run.</p><p>Music in&nbsp;his headphones, fresh cool air, and a&nbsp;scenic route are ideal conditions for a&nbsp;good workout. The jogger runs along the road on&nbsp;the coast of&nbsp;the Celtic Sea. There was a&nbsp;strong storm last night and now the sea looks calm. The man runs along the top of&nbsp;a&nbsp;low cliff and notices a&nbsp;huge vessel.</p><p>An&nbsp;old rusty cargo ship 250 feet long lies on&nbsp;the beach, right among the rocks. No&nbsp;people on&nbsp;board. It&nbsp;seems the ship has been here for ages, but the local is&nbsp;sure this vessel wasn’t here yesterday. A&nbsp;little later, it&nbsp;turns out this is&nbsp;the same ship that the sailors from the <strong>HMS Protector</strong> saw 5&nbsp;months ago, thousands of&nbsp;miles from this place.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/a6c/d3e/a028a95361984e38750624f224.jpeg><p>The cargo ship called the <strong>Alta</strong>, was built in&nbsp;1976. Nobody knows who used it&nbsp;all this time and for what purposes. It’s only known that in&nbsp;2017, the ship was purchased by&nbsp;a&nbsp;new owner and marked with the flag of&nbsp;<strong>Tanzania</strong>.</p><p>It’s important to&nbsp;say that almost all cargo ships are equipped with <strong>AIS</strong> (<strong>Automatic Identification System</strong>) which is&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;track ship movements in&nbsp;the ocean. Since <strong>2015</strong>, something strange started happening with Alta’s <strong>AIS</strong>. The ship disappeared from the satellites, then reappeared again. Over the past few years, this ship had changed several names and flags.</p><p>It’s not surprising that its AIS shut off and turned on&nbsp;numerous times. It’s said that some of&nbsp;those who disable AIS on&nbsp;their ships do&nbsp;so&nbsp;to&nbsp;hide outlaw activities. The ship’s captain, whoever it&nbsp;was, clearly didn’t want to&nbsp;show Alta’s movements. As&nbsp;<strong>AIS</strong> showed, in&nbsp;<strong>2017</strong>, the ship had sailed near Greek port cities. The Alta made 12&nbsp;stops in&nbsp;three such cities in&nbsp;different parts of&nbsp;Greece.</p><p>Then, the AIS signal disappeared, and 10&nbsp;months later, the <strong>Alta</strong> reappeared near the northern coast of&nbsp;Africa, 1,200 miles from Greece.<strong> </strong>In&nbsp;<strong>September</strong> <strong>2018</strong>, the ship was sailing about <strong>1,400&nbsp;mi (~2,200&nbsp;km) </strong>miles southeast of&nbsp;<strong>Bermuda</strong>. And at&nbsp;that time, the crew members started having problems.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/ef7/7f7/fbfa8d5a7992ea282794ae055d.jpeg><p>There were 10&nbsp;people on&nbsp;board the Alta. On&nbsp;<strong>September&nbsp;19, 2018</strong>, the ship’s engine failed right in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the Atlantic Ocean. The nearest shore was very far away. The ship began to&nbsp;drift.</p><p>As&nbsp;days passed, the crew couldn’t fix the vessel. Food supplies were running low. The crew started to&nbsp;panic and tried to&nbsp;contact someone. The situation got worse, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong hurricane was approaching the place where the ship broke down.</p><p>Crew members contacted the US&nbsp;Coast Guard. On&nbsp;October&nbsp;2, a&nbsp;helicopter headed towards the ship. Food and water were unloaded on&nbsp;the Alta. This was enough for the crew to&nbsp;bide their time for several days. About a&nbsp;week later, a&nbsp;rescue boat sailed about 1,500 miles to&nbsp;reach the Alta and help the stranded sailors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/0dd/bb7/56ba93551eb020d5638d882769.jpeg><p>Shortly before the start of&nbsp;the hurricane, American rescuers succeeded. The entire crew of&nbsp;the wrecked ship was taken to&nbsp;Puerto Rico. The Alta remained drifting in&nbsp;the ocean.</p><p>After a&nbsp;while, another ship arrived to&nbsp;tow it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the coast of&nbsp;Guyana. Then, something went wrong&nbsp;— again. The ship was hijacked. Who did&nbsp;it, and why remains a&nbsp;mystery to&nbsp;this day. But then, for some unknown reason, the thieves decided to&nbsp;abandon the ship and left it&nbsp;to&nbsp;drift into the ocean.</p><p>For almost a&nbsp;year, the ship’s location couldn’t be&nbsp;tracked. Then in&nbsp;September 2019, the vessel was found by&nbsp;the British Royal Navy. How the <strong>Alta</strong> was able to&nbsp;cover the distance across the Atlantic and wash up&nbsp;on&nbsp;the coast of&nbsp;Ireland is&nbsp;unknown. An&nbsp;investigation has been launched in&nbsp;Ireland. It’s necessary to&nbsp;identify the owner of&nbsp;the vessel and find a&nbsp;responsible person to&nbsp;take on&nbsp;the task of&nbsp;towing&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/e22/33f/f63f805101bf7694850b75bbc8.jpeg><p>But no&nbsp;one has since been found. Once, an&nbsp;unknown person called the Irish authorities and introduced themselves as&nbsp;the owner of&nbsp;the ship, but didn’t provide any evidence. Several barrels of&nbsp;oil were found on&nbsp;board the Alta. To&nbsp;dismantle the ship, the Irish authorities will need to&nbsp;spend about <strong>10&nbsp;million euros</strong>. Local residents are annoyed by&nbsp;the wreck too: corroding metal is&nbsp;bad for the environment.</p><p>And kids have already snuck on&nbsp;board and posted a&nbsp;video on&nbsp;the Internet from inside the abandoned ship. The further fate of&nbsp;the Alta remains unresolved. It’s still lying there. That ship sailed in&nbsp;the ocean for just two years. Now imagine if&nbsp;some other managed to&nbsp;drift for 38! In&nbsp;all that time, no&nbsp;one could catch this ship, and people still seek&nbsp;it. That vessel is&nbsp;called the <strong>SS&nbsp;Baychimo</strong>.</p><p>It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;merchant ship owned by&nbsp;a&nbsp;Canadian trading company. In&nbsp;<strong>1931,</strong> the ship got stuck in&nbsp;ice off the coast of&nbsp;<strong>Alaska</strong>. A&nbsp;strong snowstorm began. The team waited a&nbsp;week for it&nbsp;to&nbsp;end, but the storm only intensified. One day, the weather improved a&nbsp;bit, and part of&nbsp;the team was evacuated to&nbsp;the nearest city. Another part of&nbsp;the crew with the captain set up&nbsp;camp near the ship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/092/1a0/5cd0fc50318917badabd1c22b3.jpeg><p>The storm started again and didn’t stop for a&nbsp;long time. The blizzard was so&nbsp;heavy that the ship’s captain couldn’t see beyond his arm’s reach. Finally, when the storm was over, the captain saw that the ship... simply vanished. He&nbsp;decided the Baychimo sank during the storm. A&nbsp;week later, the ship was found drifting near the place where it&nbsp;was lost.</p><p>The hull of&nbsp;the ship was damaged so&nbsp;badly that it&nbsp;was unsafe to&nbsp;sail on&nbsp;it. The captain decided to&nbsp;abandon the ship. However, it&nbsp;didn’t sink. For the next 38&nbsp;years, it&nbsp;was drifting at&nbsp;various points along the Alaskan coast. Several times, people climbed on&nbsp;the ship, including native Alaskan residents and a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;researchers. Attempts to&nbsp;save the vessel from the sea ended in&nbsp;failure.</p><p>The salvage operations were hampered by&nbsp;drifting ice and bad weather. The last time it&nbsp;was seen was in&nbsp;<strong>1969</strong>. The ship was frozen and blocked by&nbsp;the ice. In&nbsp;<strong>2006</strong>, the government created a&nbsp;special project to&nbsp;find the Baychimo. However, in&nbsp;all these years, the ship still hasn’t been found. Its fate is&nbsp;unknown. It’s likely that the ship has finally found peace and is&nbsp;now lying on&nbsp;the seabed of&nbsp;the Chukchi Sea.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsdhmo6inm5qxbrXNrKCdnV2hvLTAjJucq6Wlma5uwNGimKefnJp6tLTIqWShnaKawG7Dx5qrZqyYmsZuv8CwZHFpY2uGdXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1603295-timbalands-net-worth-what.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Timbaland's net worth (2024): what is he doing now?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-most-emotional-dog-act-ever-on-britains-got-talent-that-made-alesha-dixon-cry-video.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Most Emotional Dog Act Ever On 'Britain's Got Talent' That Made Alesha Dixon Cry [VIDEO]</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

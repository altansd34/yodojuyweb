The episode alternated between all Top 9 singers, performing songs that fans picked for them and singer coming together as trios for the Taylor Swift songs. Here’s everything you might have missed.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fan-choice-taylor-swift-night-brings-out-the-best-worst-in-season-24-artists>Fan Choice, Taylor Swift Night Brings Out The Best, Worst in Season 24 Artists</h2><p>The first singer of the night was Team Reba’s Ruby Leigh. The young singer took the stage singing “Take Me Home, Country Road” by John Denver. This rendition was good, but it was clear Ruby had some nerves going into the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">performance</a>.</p><p>Following Ruby was the first trio of the night, Mac Royal, Lila Forde, and Huntley. Their Taylor Swift song is “Exile.” The audience absolutely loved this performance, since each singer was able to really impress. I thought that Mac was clearly below his song partners, probably due to nerves.</p><p>The next solo performer was Team Gwen’s BIAS. He took the stage singing “Bless The Broken Road” by Rascal Flatts. This was clearly one of BIAS’ best performances yet, no doubt. Fans picked a wonderful song for him.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>BIAS turned out a Rascal Flatts rendition that took us down a road to greatness! 🌟 <a href=#>#TheVoice</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/N7FNlwxxDS</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>December 12, 2023</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-team-reba-puts-a-country-twist-on-their-fan-choice-songs>Team Reba Puts a Country Twist on Their Fan-Choice Songs</h2><p>After this, Team Reba’s Jacquie Roar took the stage singing “Alive” by Sia. The singer decided to find a rendition that fit her a bit more, so she chose one that was arranged by Chris Daughtry.</p><p>Continuing the night with Team Reba is Jordan Rainer, singing “Ole Red” by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Blake Shelton</a>. Reba McEntire said that Jordan did all of America proud in this rendition. Hopefully, she doesn’t fall subject to the Instant Save again this week.</p><p>Following Jordan came Nini Iris, Mara Justine, and Jacquie Roar. The trio took the stage singing “Don’t Blame Me” by Taylor Swift. The three powerhouse vocalists seriously put on the show of the night.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-team-niall-secures-their-spot-in-the-finale>Team Niall Secures Their Spot in The Finale</h2><p>Finally, Team Niall came to the stage. This team’s portion of the episode began with Huntley. He took the stage singing “Way Down We Go” by Kaleo. This was easily the best solo performance of the night.</p><p>Up next came <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mara Justine</a>. The Team Niall singer took the stage singing “Parachute” by Chris Stapleton. Once again Mara dominated the stage, clearly earning her place in the Finale. Even coach John Legend said he regretted letting Mara go after that performance.</p><p>The final trio was Jordan, BIAS, and Ruby. The country trio was picked to perform “Mean” by Taylor Swift. This was my favorite trio of the night, since it stayed so true to the song itself, while showing off the artists.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Original_JacquieRoar_NiniIris_MaraJustine_Trae-PattonNBC.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-night-rounds-out-with-stunning-performances>The Night Rounds Out With Stunning Performances</h2><p>The first Team Legend singer to take the stage was Mac Royal. The final R&B artist left in the competition sang “Love T.K.O.” by Teddy Pendergrass. Once again, this is not the best we’ve seen from Mac, it’s clear his nerves got to him this round.</p><p>Next, Team Niall returned to the stage with Nini Iris. Fans picked “No Time to Die” by Billie Eilish as her song for this round of the competition. This was quite literally the best song fans could’ve picked for Nini, it suited her voice so well.</p><p>The final singer of the night was none other than Team Legend’s Lila Forde. After being asked in multiple rounds whether or not she’s sang Joni Mitchell yet, Lila’s fans took it upon themselves to vote in “River” by Joni Mitchell as her song.</p><p>The Voice returns on Tuesday, December 12 at 9 P.M. This results episode will announce which singers will remain in the competition for next week’s finale.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Original_CarsonDaly_BlakeShelton_NikkiGarcia_Eric-OgdenUSA-Network-220x147.jpeg alt="Nikki Garcia Wants a ‘Barmageddon’ Showdown Between ‘The Voice’ Coaches Reba McEntire, Gwen Stefani" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmedGempqoXam8sXmYZp%2Baq12frq55z5qapJ2UYrOiutJmmqGnmZiybsDAsqOoql2oxKqy02alop%2BYqXw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./we-ranked-10-of-the-most-toxic-movie-relationships-811374.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>We Ranked 10 of the Most Toxic Movie Relationships</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./8865-tony-benns-finest-speech.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tony Benns finest speech | YouGov</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

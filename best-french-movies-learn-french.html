Whether you’re still a beginner or you’ve been learning French for some time, watching French films might sound a little scary at first. You don’t know what to watch. You’re worried you won’t be able to understand anything.&nbsp;While it’s true that films meant for native speakers can be a little difficult to follow, there are a few ways to improve the experience. There are also plenty of great movies to start with.</p><ul><li>Tips for watching French films</li><li>Best French comedy movies</li><li>French movies on Netflix</li><li>Best French canadian movies</li><li>Award winning French movies</li><li>French christmas movies</li><li>French cartoons</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tips for watching French films</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Use French subtitles</h3><p>For some language learners, being able to watch movies without relying on subtitles is a big goal. However, that doesn’t mean you should feel ashamed for using them! Just be sure to watch with French subtitles. They can be especially helpful with quick dialogue and unfamiliar accents.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Watch something you’ll enjoy</h3><p>You don’t have to watch a film you don’t care for just because it’s easy to understand (or because it’s the only one you can find). In fact, you’re more likely to learn more when you’re invested in what’s going on.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Have a notebook nearby</h3><p>Watching movies is a great way to learn new words in context. Though, sometimes, you still need to look things up. Instead of pausing or trying to remember every new word you come across, keep a notebook and pen nearby to write down any words that stand out. That way you can look them up later.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Must-see French films&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>La Marche de l’Empereur</strong></p><p>Are you a fan of documentaries? They’re not the first choice for most people, but French beginners might find this nature documentary both fascinating and easy to follow. For starters, there’s only one narrator with a clear speaking voice. You also don’t have to worry about<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;tricky slang</a></strong>&nbsp;words. Finally, if you’ve seen the English version, you already know what happens.</p><p><strong>Kirikou et la Sorcière</strong></p><p>Those who enjoy animated films should definitely check this one out. In fact, lots of movies meant for kids are great options for&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>French learners</a></strong>&nbsp;because they often follow familiar patterns.</p><p>In addition to having easy-to-follow French,&nbsp;Kirikou et la Sorcière&nbsp;is a great introduction to French African accents.</p><p><strong>Le fabuleux destin d’Amélie</strong></p><p>Chances are you’ve already heard of this film, also known simply as&nbsp;Amélie. This quirky French classic follows Amélie Poulain as she tries to bring joy to those around her.</p><p>Overall, if you’re a fan of light comedy and Audrey Tautou, give this movie a try.</p><p><strong>Les Choristes</strong></p><p>When it comes to feel good movies,&nbsp;Les Choristes&nbsp;is one you shouldn’t miss. It follows the story of a teacher at a boys’ boarding school who does his best to positively influence his students by starting a choir. In short, it’s musical, touching, and uplifting.</p><p>Plus, the plot is easy to follow, so French learners can watch it without feeling completely lost.</p><p><strong>Le Dîner de Cons</strong></p><p>Intermediate French learners might want to have a good laugh with this film.</p><p>The plot revolves around a group of friends who challenge each other to bring the “stupidest person” they can to dinner. You can only imagine how such an idea could backfire.</p><p>The comedy in this film isn’t too difficult for French learners to follow, though the dialogue can be a bit more challenging compared to the other films on this list.</p><p><strong>Les Parapluies de Cherbourg</strong></p><p>Are you a fan of musicals? If so, this romantic drama from 1964 is the perfect introduction to a French film that sings every line.</p><p>For some French learners, the fact that lines are sung rather than spoken can actually make it easier to understand. Fans of classic films will also appreciate the old-time charm and drama.</p><p>Get practising your French before you start watching these movies with a free 7-day trial with Lingoda’s French teachers.

After a bad experience with elementary school Spanish classes, she fell in love with learning French. Now, in addition to French, she spends a considerable amount of time learning Japanese and has jumped back into learning Spanish. Like many avid language learners, she plans to continue learning more languages than she has hours in the day. When she isn’t writing or learning, she loves reading, traveling, video games, and all forms of chocolate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXNoKadmV6YvK57waWmoGeVo3yjsdKtZJ%2BqlaOwqXnMqK2inaNiuaat0adkn6qVo7Cpew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brian-austin-green-calls-out-dwts-for-snubbing-sharna-burgess.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brian Austin Green Calls Out 'DWTS' for Snubbing Sharna Burgess</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1594253-angela-simmons-siblings-meet-all-the-talented-simmons-siblings.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Angela Simmons' siblings: Meet all the talented Simmons siblings</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

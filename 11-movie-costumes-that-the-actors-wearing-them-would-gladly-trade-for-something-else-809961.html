So&nbsp;it&nbsp;just may happen that actors are not really happy with the costumes they have to&nbsp;don while filming.</p><p><h2>Angelina Jolie&nbsp;— Lara Croft’s costume</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c44/663/6b3b9e54d1a20512be08b9dc7b.jpg><p><a href=# title="Angelina Jolie" data-link=tag>Angelina Jolie</a> didn’t really enjoy her costume for <i>Tomb Raider</i> because it&nbsp;was too tight. Also, to&nbsp;look like the main heroine of&nbsp;the computer game of&nbsp;the same name, the actress had to&nbsp;wear <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>padded</a> prosthetics to&nbsp;increase her breast size.</p><p><h2>Kit Harington&nbsp;— Jon Snow’s costume</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a4f/875/dab55b543a99324a6f8f097a5d.jpg><p>The actor revealed that his costume was unbelievably <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>heavy</a> and seemed like it&nbsp;weighed a&nbsp;ton. Also, he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;feeling that the costume designers made it&nbsp;heavier every following year. Harington also mentioned that it&nbsp;smelled awful.</p><p><h2>Emilia Clarke&nbsp;— Daenerys’s costumes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a44/3fc/5df522541f9ed2926af61859b5.jpg><p>The other <i>Game of&nbsp;Thrones</i> star believes that her male colleagues were lucky because their costumes were better than the female ones. Some scenes were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>filmed</a> in&nbsp;hotter climates, and male costumes had a&nbsp;special cooling system inside. Unfortunately, women didn’t get this relief. <a href=# title="Emilia Clarke" data-link=tag>Emilia Clarke</a>, for example, was only allowed to&nbsp;have her wig lifted&nbsp;up.</p><p><h2>Ryan Reynolds&nbsp;— Green Lantern’s costume</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/de5/b45/77480a51cfaa5a3b3ad478e52d.jpg><p>This superhero costume was fully <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>created</a> with the help of&nbsp;computer graphics. The actor had to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;special motion picture suit that was later transformed into Green Lantern’s costume during the post-production stage. <a href=# title="Ryan Reynolds" data-link=tag>Ryan Reynolds</a> revealed that the suit was so&nbsp;uncomfortable that he&nbsp;would rather wear a&nbsp;real superhero suit.</p><p>The movie was a&nbsp;box office flop, and many people mentioned that the superhero looked pretty <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>unconvincing</a>. Reynolds said that he&nbsp;didn’t even know what Green Lantern’s suit was supposed to&nbsp;look like and saw it&nbsp;only in&nbsp;the first trailer for the movie.</p><p><h2>Carrie Fisher&nbsp;— Princess Leia’s costume</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/912/74c/4b1da75f49882434699d72d4a2.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the movie, <i>Star Wars: Episode VI&nbsp;— Return of&nbsp;the Jedi</i>, Princess Leia was captured and imprisoned by&nbsp;Jabba the Hutt. And during her imprisonment, she had to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;very revealing costume, a&nbsp;metallic bikini. Carrie Fisher herself <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that this costume would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;curse, even for supermodels. She had to&nbsp;sit very straight because she couldn’t have lines on&nbsp;her sides.</p><p>In&nbsp;general, Fisher believed that such clothes objectified a&nbsp;woman, but she didn’t have much of&nbsp;a&nbsp;choice. She also recommended to&nbsp;the actresses who acted in&nbsp;the latest episodes of&nbsp;<i>Star Wars</i> to&nbsp;fight for their right not to&nbsp;wear such outfits.</p><p><h2>Benedict Cumberbatch&nbsp;— Sherlock Holmes’ costumes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/884/fc1/c2cd1f5fc5808367085a4ae0a3.jpg><p>The actor who played this brilliant detective revealed that he&nbsp;wasn’t fond of&nbsp;Sherlock’s costumes. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that even though the outfits were well-tailored, the waist was way too small. This is&nbsp;why he&nbsp;felt uncomfortable on&nbsp;set and couldn’t breathe or&nbsp;digest properly.</p><p><a href=# title="Benedict Cumberbatch" data-link=tag>Benedict Cumberbatch</a> was also concerned that he&nbsp;couldn’t wear some of&nbsp;his favorite clothes anymore. The fact is&nbsp;that some of&nbsp;them looked very much like the detective’s garments, and people began to&nbsp;associate the actor with his character.</p><p><h2>Margot Robbie&nbsp;— Harley Quinn’s costume</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1f4/e75/bcf76b5a90a7b99999e73f10f8.jpg><p>The style of&nbsp;this supervillain became iconic, mostly thanks to&nbsp;her costume, which consisted of&nbsp;a&nbsp;ripped white T-shirt, short sparkly shorts, and fishnet tights. But the actress wasn’t really <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fond</a> of&nbsp;this costume.</p><p><a href=# title="Margot Robbie" data-link=tag>Margot Robbie</a> said that during the scene where she was hosed down and soaked wet in&nbsp;a&nbsp;white T-shirt, it&nbsp;became so&nbsp;clingy, she felt self-conscious about&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>Elizabeth Olsen&nbsp;— Scarlet Witch’s costume</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/303/eaf/578d88520bb40786324fa5bc08.jpg><p>Elizabeth Olsen once noticed that in&nbsp;<i>Avengers</i>, only her character’s costume had <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cleavage</a>. Other actresses were more covered, and she also wanted her chest to&nbsp;be&nbsp;covered&nbsp;up.</p><p>But she understands that this is&nbsp;just an&nbsp;iconic image that is&nbsp;rooted in&nbsp;comics, and it&nbsp;doesn’t represent the average woman.</p><p><h2>Chris Hemsworth&nbsp;— Thor’s costume<br></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f1c/ec2/c47b6851d9b7ddf86784a471c3.jpg><p>The armor of&nbsp;the Norse god looked terrific but was uncomfortable. The actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> that after a&nbsp;few months of&nbsp;filming, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;pretty difficult thing for him to&nbsp;wake up&nbsp;and put the outfit on&nbsp;every morning.</p><p>At&nbsp;some point, <a href=# title="Chris Hemsworth" data-link=tag>Chris Hemsworth</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bulked up</a>&nbsp;so&nbsp;much that he&nbsp;couldn’t fit into his costume anymore. His hands would start going numb because the sleeves were so&nbsp;tight. Luckily, costume designers altered the outfit, and Hemsworth was able to&nbsp;continue his work on&nbsp;the movie.</p><p><h2>Alyssa Milano&nbsp;— Phoebe’s costumes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/40d/6c1/ecaa2658959d274f87f5813af8.jpg><p>The main characters of&nbsp;<i>Charmed</i> changed multiple costumes throughout the series. But according to&nbsp;Alyssa Milano, many of&nbsp;them were too revealing. In&nbsp;80% of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>scenes</a>, they were dressed in&nbsp;something that looked like underwear. But even&nbsp;so, Alyssa Milano loved the series and its characters.</p><p>By&nbsp;the way, the producer of&nbsp;the show <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confirmed</a> that the television company required them to&nbsp;have more revealing looks on-screen.</p><p><h2>Tom Holland&nbsp;— Spider-Man’s costume<br></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/856/318/5cf91e5c70b970a5c91518772d.jpg><p>Tom Holland <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview that his costume was made from very coarse material, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;thong and a&nbsp;mesh underlay suit underneath to&nbsp;protect his skin. Also, the outfit had hidden zippers that no&nbsp;one could ever find, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;was really difficult to&nbsp;take off.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you think movie costumes should be&nbsp;comfortable, or&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;character’s overall look more important?</p><p>Angelina Jolie has been a&nbsp;<a href=#>beacon of&nbsp;inspiration</a>, not just for her cinematic achievements but also for her personal journey and values. Here’s a&nbsp;glimpse into her world: Angelina Jolie has taken a&nbsp;bold stance against societal pressures on&nbsp;women’s bodies, emphasizing the importance of&nbsp;self-acceptance and challenging beauty norms.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5yecyoraKdXZi8tMDUppysZaSdrrV506GcZpmTqbyzv4ywnJqqmaO0bsDHnqRmr5%2BquaV5xqWYnaSpYsGzrcOeZJ%2BnomLAsLnErZ%2Bippdisq2%2FxGZvaXFpa35w</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./12-people-who-had-to-face-a-jarring-revelation-819779.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>12 People Who Had to Face a Jarring Revelation</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1460247-100-royal-princess-names-history-popular-culture.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>100+ royal princess names from history and popular culture</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

He was able to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hide his identity</a></strong> <strong>from his wife Jenny McCarthy, the current holder of the Golden Ear trophy. It was not super easy for him to do so</strong>.<strong> He had to be very tactical and secretive leading up to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his big reveal.</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jenny-mccarthy-is-still-feeling-shame-about-not-guessing-her-husband-before-his-masked-singer-reveal>Jenny McCarthy is Still Feeling Shame About Not Guessing Her Husband Before His ‘Masked Singer’ Reveal</h2><p>Wahlberg was unmasked during last week’s episode of The Masked Singer featuring guest judge Darius Rucker. None of the judges guessed The Cluedle-Doo’s identity correctly, which led to a hugely embarrassing moment when he was revealed. The couple spoke about the big reveal during a joint appearance on The Talk.</p><p>“What was going through my mind was complete shame because I like to brag that I’m one of the best panelists, I won the golden ear, I knnow people’s voices and when he took that mask off I was in total shock,” McCarthy admitted. “I literally lost my footing and was shaking for about an hour.”</p><p>McCarthy knew that she would catch a lot of flack on social media for not recognizing her husband’s voice. Wahlberg knew that to trick his wife, he had to keep everything under wraps. The couple does everything together, so it was not going to be easy to pull off.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><br><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-wahlberg-pulled-off-his-epic-reveal-without-anyone-guessing-correctly>How Wahlberg Pulled off His Epic Reveal Without Anyone Guessing Correctly</h2><p>Wahlberg knows McCarthy’s schedule on The Masked Singer and that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the judges</a> aren’t really allowed to have their phones on the panel. Just 45 minutes before <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he performed</a> as The Cluedle-Doo <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ahead of his reveal,</a> Wahlberg FaceTimed McCarthy. He spoke to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Robin Thicke</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nicole Scherzinger </a>who are old friends of his. His main goal was to have all of the judges convinced that he was in New York filming his show Blue Bloods.</p><p>“I had Danny Reagan’s suit jacket and tie from Blue Bloods and I just pretended I was on set, so even though I think a few of them might have suspected it was me, they just spoke to me on FaceTime and they were certain that I was in New York,” he said.</p><p>An hour prior to the big reveal, Wahlberg posted a photo from the set of Blue Bloods to further convince the judges that he was in New York. Really, he was ready to give his wife the biggest shock of her life!</p><p>With the biggest reveal of the season out of the way, McCarthy revealed who she is rooting for in the upcoming finale of The Masked Singer. She along with millions of viewers want <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Black Swan</a> to win. We think we have a pretty good idea of The Black Swan’s identity based on all of her clue packages.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Thumbnail_PhotoByWeissEubanks-NBCUniversal_NBCUniversalMediaPark.jpg alt="‘The Kelly Clarkson Show’ Nominated for Six Daytime Emmys" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57x6iuZpyfo7uqsYywmKGkkpq%2FqHnHoqOaqpmkwrS42Gafopxdoq60t8SdZKyhnpyys3nRnq2emZxis7O7zGahnqaernqur8Kaqa2gqWQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1567236-how-moki-doorstep-shark-tank-appearance.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How is Moki Doorstep doing after the Shark Tank appearance?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./everything-to-know-about-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-how-i-met-your-mother-star-alyson-hannigan.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Everything to Know About 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer', 'How I Met Your Mother' Star Alyson Hannigan</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

The location and its susceptibility to bacteria make it more vulnerable to infections. Below are some tips to follow:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b0af868336fc5a91.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30 trendiest teen boy haircuts you definitely have to try</span></p></a><ul><li>Be careful when using headphones until you have healed. Since the piercing is still fresh, putting pressure on it may cause trauma to the area and provoke complications. You can instead wear earbuds and ensure you don't put pressure on your jewellery.</li><li>Be cautious when you sleep. One of the most critical care steps after the piercing is to watch how you sleep. Don't sleep on your side, as this will pressure the area. The bedding used should be clean and free of bacteria to avoid infection.</li><li>Don't move your tragus jewellery. This is more than just a standard rule for cartilage piercing. It is essential to allow healing and avoid bumps and other skin traumas.</li><li>Keep the ear extra clean. Earwax should not come near the area. It is used to keep your ear bacteria-free but could contain harmful entities. Additionally, keep the ear canal and jewellery clean.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/26daaf2fd3199012.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30 fascinating tattoo sleeve ideas to bring out your inner artist</span></p></a><h3 id=1593203-how-painful-is-a-tragus-piercing class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>How painful is a tragus piercing?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5dfe9f47630eed78.png><p class=align-left>Any piercing is painful, but the levels of pain may vary. The tragus doesn't have many nerves, which makes the pain manageable. However, the area has a cartilage, which makes it challenging to penetrate compared to other places.</p><p class=align-left>During the procedure, one will likely feel like a sting as the needle gets through the skin. The pressure exerted makes it a bit painful since the cartilage is more complex than normal skin as the needle enters.</p><p class=align-left>The professional must ensure the needle is sharp enough to ensure a smooth and short procedure, minimizing discomfort.

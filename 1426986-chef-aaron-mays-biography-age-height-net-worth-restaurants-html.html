As of August 2021, Aaron May's age is 43 years old.</p><h3>How did Aaron may get his start?</h3><p class=align-left>Aaron is a professional chef with a strong interest in food. May started working in the pantry of a Chicago steakhouse when he was 15 years old. He contemplated becoming a chef after spending hours watching TV celebrity chefs Graham Kerr and David Rosengarten.</p><p class=align-left>He dropped out of his political science degree at the age of 20 to enrol in Scottsdale Community College's culinary arts program. After graduation, he moved to Paris, where he spent a year polishing his abilities as a classically trained chef at L'Ecole Ritz Escoffier.</p><p class=align-left>He began his professional career at the Four Seasons Resort in Scottsdale, where he worked at Crescent Moon and Acacia before joining star chef Douglas Rodgriguez at Deseo at the Westin Kierland Resort & Spa.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f9339604787f17ef.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Imaqtpie Michael Santana biography: age, height, net worth, wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>May stayed with Rodriguez for another two years, travelling with him and working at his many Manhattan restaurants while being taught in the modern, deconstructionist style to cooking that he now employs. He has since started his restaurants and has established himself as one of the top chefs in the United States.</p><p class=align-left>He also recently became the head chef at Hollywood restaurants Dough Pizzeria and Bar on the Sunset Strip. In addition, Aaron has been on numerous television shows as a host, judge, or participant. <i>Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, Best Thing I Ever Ate, and Guy's Grocery Games</i> are just a few of the shows.</p><h3>Does Aaron May own a restaurant?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/441ff862c9755fd9.jpg><p class=align-left>Yes, he does. His first ever restaurant was called Sol y Sombra, and it opened its doors in 2006. Unfortunately, it is no longer operational. May has had several misses in his career, as some of his restaurants did not live long. This includes The Yacht Club in Arcadia, Vitamin T, Autostrada, and Iruña.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/04841a5185a9afbb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Matthew Trebek bio: what is known about Alex Trebek's son?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, his next venture, Over Easy, which he launched in 2008, has been an overwhelming success.

Other Aaron May's restaurants include the Lodge Sasquatch Kitchen and Goodwood Tavern.</p><h3>Where is Aaron May now?</h3><p class=align-left>The American chef is currently based in Scottsdale, Arizona. He is the executive chef and director at Bullseye Event Group.</p><p class=align-left>Back in 2020, May was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shot into the limelight</a> thanks to his work with the famous TikTok stars Dixie and Charli D'Amelio. He cooked for their family, but the girls were not impressed with his food, actively showing their displeasure with the meal. This did not sit well with their fans, and D'Amelios lost a lot of followers.</p><p class=align-left>After a tearful apology from Charli and an interview with May, who said that the incident was blown out of proportion, TikTok stars gained their followers back. Moreover, Dixie invited Aaron again for a video, where she and her boyfriend Noah tried increasingly weird foods cooked up by May.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ffc6634e32a3426f.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Fascinating facts about George Santo Pietro, Vanna White’s ex-husband</span></p></a><p class=align-left>On April 25th, 2021, he had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">an outdoor bash</a> called Aaron May's Big Boy Cook Club Cookout at Walter Sterling's Ocotillo Restaurant in Central Phoenix.</p><h3>What is Aaron May chef's height?</h3><p class=align-left>May stands at 6 feet 3 inches (190 cm) tall.</p><h3>How much is chef Aaron May worth?</h3><p class=align-left>Aaron May's net worth is allegedly $2 million, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Famous Chefs</a>, as well as several other sources.

However, her family was always there for her when she needed them the most.</p><p><h2>The new mom and dad were completely surprised when their daughter was born.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/c70/3d4/5787585bd38f1129d58d308fce.jpeg><p>A&nbsp;man and his wife were really excited because they were going to&nbsp;have their first baby. The mom-to-be, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Jennie Wilklow</a>, had been wanting to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;mom for a&nbsp;long time. She and her husband had prepared for the pregnancy and hoped that everything would go&nbsp;well, so&nbsp;they could have the little girl they were so&nbsp;thrilled about.</p><p>Jennie even picked out cute outfits for her future daughter and imagined the day she would hold her baby and dress her up&nbsp;in&nbsp;those adorable outfits she carefully planned. When she finally got pregnant, things were going great. Her check-up didn’t show anything unusual, and the couple was eagerly awaiting the birth of&nbsp;their daughter.</p><p><h2>As&nbsp;Jennie was on&nbsp;her way to&nbsp;the operating room, she woke&nbsp;up, reached for her husband, and asked if&nbsp;everything was okay.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/ab4/c56/ba2a8d5f55ac97678d82735542.jpeg><p>“Things were all seemingly perfect. Moments after her skin hit the air it&nbsp;began to&nbsp;harden and then split causing open wounds all over her body,” Wilklow, 34, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>told</a> of&nbsp;her daughter’s birth in&nbsp;September 2017. For months, the baby’s skin had been thickening, but once exposed to&nbsp;the air, it&nbsp;became dry and rigid, resembling armor.</p><p>Jennie Wilklow remembers the astonishment among the hospital staff as&nbsp;her daughter’s eyes swelled shut, and the circulation in&nbsp;the baby’s hands and feet was cut off. The doctors and nurses showed visible signs of&nbsp;distress, and her husband sat silently in&nbsp;the post-op room.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/69f/8f6/dbfb7a5c3c856e4bb3a69897fe.jpeg><p>Anna had <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>harlequin ichthyosis</a>, a&nbsp;rare condition where newborns develop thick, splitting, and cracking plates of&nbsp;skin around their body, as&nbsp;explained by&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>First Skin Foundation</a>.</p><p>This skin hardening significantly alters an&nbsp;infant’s appearance and can lead to&nbsp;their lips and eyelids turning inside out. It&nbsp;may also result in&nbsp;constriction around their chest, making it&nbsp;challenging for them to&nbsp;breathe and eat.</p><p><h2>In&nbsp;the past, infants born with harlequin ichthyosis usually didn’t survive more than a&nbsp;few days after birth.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/013/99a/0ffbe551d7bc5797de40879607.jpeg><p>However, thanks to&nbsp;medical progress, many individuals with this condition have been able to&nbsp;live into their teenage years or&nbsp;even into their twenties with normal mental and intellectual development. Nonetheless, the First Skin Foundation notes that some newborns with severe harlequin ichthyosis may not survive.</p><p>The treatment for this disease is&nbsp;highly intensive and involves a&nbsp;meticulous skincare routine to&nbsp;keep the skin moisturized and soft, preventing infections. Wilklow diligently applies Aquaphor, a&nbsp;healing ointment, to&nbsp;Anna’s skin every few hours.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/508/e36/406252515b89d46bbd3b9def76.jpeg><p>Wilklow, who hails from Highland, New York, made the decision to&nbsp;leave her job and be&nbsp;a&nbsp;full-time caregiver for Anna to&nbsp;ensure she receives all the care she needs. She expresses contentment with her choice, acknowledging that Anna faces many challenges, but she remains resilient, which inspires her mother to&nbsp;stay positive.</p><p>Due to&nbsp;Anna’s excessive skin production, she requires a&nbsp;substantial daily calorie intake of&nbsp;2,100&nbsp;calories. Jennie Wilklow <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explains</a>, “We&nbsp;have to&nbsp;adjust to&nbsp;the heat, the cold, and her skin.” “[We&nbsp;have] her multiple two-hour baths a&nbsp;day and daily caloric needs, and we&nbsp;have weekly occupational therapy and bi-weekly physical therapy.”</p><p><h2>“Anna’s personality is&nbsp;always happy and incredibly loving,” Wilklow says of&nbsp;her daughter.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/0c0/0d2/a9f1eb50f18a989427f88924de.jpeg><p>Now the family is&nbsp;also active on&nbsp;<a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a>, with Wilklow regularly sharing updates on&nbsp;their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Instagram</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Facebook</a> pages to&nbsp;raise awareness about the disease and document Anna’s journey.</p><p>In&nbsp;May 2023, they shared a&nbsp;photo that highlighted Anna’s remarkable growth since her birth. In&nbsp;the caption, the affectionate parents <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>referred</a> to&nbsp;her as&nbsp;their <strong>“beauty queen”</strong> and openly discussed the support they had received from individuals living with the same condition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/aeb/8db/b40cd35d8e8c74df42b08373e6.jpeg><p>Jennie Wilklow expresses that she has learned valuable lessons from Anna, including self-trust, self-compassion, and the determination to&nbsp;improve each day.</p><p>Wilklow hopes that Anna’s story serves as&nbsp;an&nbsp;inspiration for others, encouraging them to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;the positive aspects of&nbsp;life even when faced with adversity. She emphasizes that happiness is&nbsp;a&nbsp;choice and is&nbsp;not solely determined by&nbsp;life’s circumstances. <strong>Every morning, when she wakes up&nbsp;to&nbsp;see Anna’s radiant smile, she feels a&nbsp;profound sense of&nbsp;gratitude.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/189/815/6e1628503abb62ebd75af06db3.jpeg><p>this is just not true.

Every so often, a singer comes around with a voice that hits an octave so high, even Mariah Carey would be impressed. Here are 8 Male Talent Show Singers who have showcased such a rare talent.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jimmie-herrod>Jimmie Herrod</h2><p>Jimmie Herrod wowed the judges so much during his audition that he received a <a href=#>Golden Buzzer</a>. He performed “Tomorrow” from the hit broadway musical Annie. Jimmie’s voice immediately stopped the room and had every judge shocked, eventually all giving him a standing ovation. The Portland Oregon native made it to the finals, but came up short against magician Dustin Tavella. Fans who are missing Herrod can listen to his album Falling in Love and Learning to Love Myself.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Greg Pritchard</h2><p>Greg Pritchard taught us all the lesson to never judge a book by its cover. In 2009, the Britain’s Got Talent contestant walked on the stage with his hair spiked and wearing a leather jacket. Looking at him, we thought we would hear the next rock star, but we were wrong.</p><p>Pritchard belted out the Giacomo Puccini classic “Nessun Dormà.” Many of the fans as well as the judges looked on in confusion. At one point one of the hosts believed that a recording was playing and not Pritchard actually singing, that’s how amazing he was.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Adam Lambert</h2><p>Adam Lambert was the runner up in Season 8 of American Idol. He took the Idol stage by storm, fusing in his theatrical experience and giving it a rock star edge. His rendition of Aerosmith’s “Cryin” is considered to be one of the best performances on the American Idol stage. Lambert was so talented that the remaining members of Queen made him a part of their iconic band. Shortly after his Idol season, Lambert embarked on a world tour with the group. Now fans can catch Lambert on the new talent show <a href=#>Clash of the Cover Bands</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CVYZrBcPhu-/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dimash Kudaibergen</h2><p>Dimash Kudaibergen appeared on the 2019 talent show special, World Best. The crowd and the 50 expert judges were all standing on their feet inspired by Dimash Kudaibergen’s voice. He performed “All By Myself,” and he went big. Decked out in an old gold ensemble the <a href=#>Masked Singer</a> alum, ended his performance by taking the audience on a journey through his six octave range.</p><p>The singer shocked everyone when he withdrew from the contest to allow younger singers a chance to win. Recently, it was announced that Kudaibergen will participate in an untitled new reality TV show based in China. The show will not be a singing competition.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Donovan</h2><p>When <a href=#>Donovan </a>opened his mouth during his Season 16 America’s Got Talent audition, judge Sofia Vergara leaned over to Simon Cowell and asked “How does he do that?” Cowell simply replied “I don’t know.”</p><p>Donovan showed why he was a popular TikToker when he performed “Think of Me” from Phantom of the Opera. The singer told the judges that he had his sights set on Broadway. This past summer, Donovan performed in a concert with PRIMA Theatre featuring the music of Queen and Journey.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Che Chesterman</h2><p>Che Chesterman appeared on X Factor UK back in 2015. He started his rendition of Jessie J’s “Who You Are” and his nerves showed. As he continued his performance, the cheers from the audience gave him enough confidence to show his talent and hit high notes as his audition was coming to a close. Chesterman is now working on music and touring the club scene after appearing on the show.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/COYdb_kjCVC/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sammulous</h2><p>Sammulus embodied the legendary Sylvester during Season 12 of America’s Got Talent. The singer showed his charisma as well as energy when he brought showmanship to the Got Talent stage. His “Mighty Real” performance during the Judges’ Cuts had the audience on their feet. Sammulus continued to perform in shows after his time on AGT, but he recently revealed that he has turned to relief work and has helped feed over 6,600 Afghanistan refugees at an army base.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Travis Pratt</h2><p>Travis Pratt stood quietly over the audience and waited to surprise them all with his voice. At his Season 8 audition, Pratt showed viewers that he was an opera singer. The judges beamed not knowing what to expect. Pratt continued to pull at the hearts of viewers when he immediately<a href=#> proposed to his girlfriend</a>. Pratt is now a fitness expert as well as a vocal coach.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/QOTU_106_GL_0416_R.jpeg alt="Grag Queen Beats Ada Vox to Win ‘Queen of the Universe’ Season 1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Americas Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57z6KrnKBdpbKzssScq2alkaGybsDApZynrF2otbDDjKygp5%2BVp8Buw8eoZJynpaGxbrTIrWStoJVitaqzx2alqKyVqHw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./poll-gmail-dominates-email-use.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Poll: Gmail Dominates Email Use Among Millennials, Gen X</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1503395-move-burna-boy-reacts-lover-stefflon-don-shading-fans-wild-reaction-it.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Move On: Burna Boy Reacts to His Ex-lover Stefflon Don Shading Him, Fans Go Wild in Reaction t</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

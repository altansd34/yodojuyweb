Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) said on the House floor. “Now they’re coming for our ceiling fans.”</p><p>And not just any celling fans, she said. The “reasonably priced,&nbsp;highly decorative fans,” would suffer the most, Blackburn said.</p><p>Blackburn and Alexander’s home state of Tennessee is also where leading ceiling fan manufacturer Hunter Fan Co. is headquartered.</p><p>Rep. Marcy Kaptur (Ohio), the top Democrat on energy and water appropriations subcommittee, shot back during the 2013 floor debate, calling the Blackburn amendment “anti-consumer.” She cited DOE estimates that new efficiency rules would save consumers $4.3 billion through 2030.</p><p>Kaptur’s family owns a ceiling fan business.</p><p>The House in 2013 adopted Blackburn’s amendment on a mostly party line vote of 227-198. Last week the House adopted the same amendment as part of an energy and water appropriations bill.</p><p>If the 2013 House showdown is any indicator, ceiling fans could spark vibrant debate as the Senate Energy Committee drafts its comprehensive energy reform.</p><p>In the Senate this year, the issue hasn’t yet risen to contention. Democratic senators like Maria Cantwell (Wash.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.) – two efficiency hawks on the Energy Committee – said they weren’t prepared to comment.</p><p>The panel will likely vote on Alexander’s bill in the coming weeks.</p><p>The American Lighting Association, a trade group representing more than 3,000 members in the lighting, ceiling fan and controls industries, doesn’t seem overly concerned. The DOE regulation “wasn’t specifically as harmful as we had feared, but they’re only proposed rules,” Michael Weems, ALA’s vice president of government affairs, said in an interview.</p><p>He said it was too early for ALA to take a position on Alexander’s bill. He declined to comment on whether ALA supports the idea of banning efficiency regulations on ceiling fans. “We hope to see a rule that is palatable and does not have an impact on market,” he said.</p><p>Several fan manufacturers, including ALA members Westinghouse Lighting Corp., Fanimation Inc., and Memphis-based Hunter, submitted comments to DOE saying the proposed rules are unnecessary, counterproductive and would be costly.</p><p>“Additional regulations at this time will result in higher fan costs to consumers, leading to the increased use of HVAC systems and rising energy consumption,” Hunter wrote.</p><p>Big Ass Fan Co., however, “supports the DOE in its effort to establish technologically feasible and economically justifiable energy conservation regulations,” the Lexington, Kentucky-based company wrote in the comments it submitted to DOE.</p><p>The federal agency has had the authority to regulate the energy efficiency level of ceiling fans since 2005, when President George W. Bush and a Republican-controlled Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act. While there are design standards and test procedures for fans, there are no energy conservation regulations in place, according to DOE’s <a href=#>website</a>.</p><p>While efficiency standards have been blocked through the annual appropriations process, Congress has never passed an authorization measure that would prohibit regulating the efficiency of a certain product.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiln6e7qrrGnKanq6WhwW%2BvzqZma2hhanxxgY5qZ2idlpu2pLXEp5qyZZSar6LAxGaqsKGiocBurdGorKecXZiyqrjIp55mnpGjwHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./goals-on-sunday.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Goals On Sunday popularity &amp;amp; fame</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1603676-dorothe-lep-s-bio-franois-henri-pinaults-wife.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dorothe Lepre's bio: where is Franois-Henri Pinault's ex-wife now?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

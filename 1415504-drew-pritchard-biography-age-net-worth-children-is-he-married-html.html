His dad was a self-employed sign writer. He used to make signs for local antique shops. The<a href=#> high-end vehicles</a> of dealers who came to collect the signs caught Andrew's attention and provoked his curiosity towards his dad's <a href=#>business</a>.</p><h2>Career history</h2><p class=align-left>Drew Pritchard's antique dealings and passion developed from a young age while watching his dad working on them. He, therefore, became a stained-glass restorer apprentice shortly after completing school.</p><p class=align-left>The young lad used to collect items washed up <a href=#>on the river</a> banks, old bikes and car parts.

He did not buy anything to renovate the home except for the shower.</p><p class=align-left>The five-bedroom, three-bathroom property now has many antiques and reclaimed ecclesiastical items.

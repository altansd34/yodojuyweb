But along with knowing how to start, structure and successfully sign off an email, getting comfortable with the nuances of this type of language is important to truly master it.</span></p><h2>Best English passive aggressive phrases</h2><p><span>If we compare writing someone an email to speaking to them on the phone, or even, in person, we’ll soon realise a major difference. How do we tell if that person is sad, happy or even, at worst, angry? When speaking, we know this by the </span><i><span>tone</span></i><span> of their voice, which we often register without realising. When writing, however, tone is often less obvious. We must pay attention to sentence length, punctuation use and even specific phrasings or word choice.</span> <span>Applying this to a work context, how can we make sure therefore to recognise if someone is actually angry with us but doing so in a “professional” way? Continue reading to see which phrases can indicate this so-called ‘passive aggression’, as we call it, while emailing in English. &nbsp;</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Frustrated-Angry-Entrepreneur-225809740.jpg alt="passive-aggressive-email " width=900 height=600 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><b>1. A friendly reminder that…</b></h2><p><span>Sadly, this phrase is not as well-intentioned as it may seem. In reality this means that someone has told you to do something multiple times and the deadline has well and truly passed.</span> <span>The reality is that they intend to continue sending you emails until you reply or resolve the issue, so take it as a warning.</span></p><h2><b>2. As per my last email</b></h2><p><span>This one, along with, “as I have already told you”, means the sender feels you haven’t quite read their previous email carefully enough and feel no desire to repeat themselves.</span> <span>Either you have misunderstood their point or are asking for information that they have already given to you, so be wary of asking for further clarifications if you see this one!</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Worried-Woman-Using-A-Laptop-I-204590263.jpg alt=passive-aggressive-woman width=900 height=600 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><b>3. As stated above</b></h2><p><span>When sending emails it’s common for information to get lost or meanings to become unclear, such as in the previous example. This phrase specifically means you haven’t read something mentioned previously in the “conversation”, or more accurately, the thread of emails. A thread refers to a chain of emails that are all linked together by the same subject.</span></p><h2><b>4. Just to clarify</b></h2><p><span><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Just</a></strong></span><span> is a word native speakers of English often overuse, to the point where it actually adds no significant meaning to a sentence. More often than not, it is used to “cushion” an incoming blow, and by this I mean, to lower the strength or severity of the information that follows it. When used with the verb, “to clarify”, here the person you are communicating with is providing you with an explanation that they don’t consider particularly warranted. &nbsp;</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-221705098-1024x683.jpg alt=frustrated-woman-passive-aggressive width=900 height=600 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><b>5. It has come to my attention that</b></h2><p><span>If we imagine the email equivalent of a fire alarm, this phrase is the glass box that someone breaks to activate it. The basic meaning you should take from reading this one is that you’ve completely messed up and the executioner is currently sharpening his axe ready for your execution. You can also interpret this one to mean someone has given some sensitive information to your boss or a superior. So be wary, there could be an office snake among you!</span></p><h2><b>6. Thank you in advance</b></h2><p><span>This phrase is perhaps my favourite of the b</span>est English passive aggressive phrases<span>. On the surface it appears quite innocent and polite, as, after all, the person is thanking you. Well, not exactly. The use of “in advance” is a polite way of giving an order. The writer is subtly asserting that they don’t in fact need something doing now, but in fact that it should have been done yesterday!</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigstock-Smiling-Young-Asian-Businesswo-240331666.jpg alt=email-writing width=900 height=600 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Over to you</strong></h2><p><span>So there you have my guide to spotting passive aggression in emails. As stated at the beginning, be mindful of the importance of tone when writing professional communications. If in doubt, even have a colleague read over your message before hitting send. Keep an eye out in particular for the phrases I have mentioned. If you see them, take care to respond accordingly to ensure your workplace communications remain clear and, more importantly, that your work-space remains conflict free.</span></p><p>Would you like to try out some passive aggressive phrases in English?

Languages, without a doubt, have been a lifelong passion of his. After 10 years of learning French, Spanish and German, he gained his bachelors in Spanish and Portuguese and then moved to Madrid for two years after graduating from university. Throughout this journey, he has gained a love for linguistics and a curiosity for how we use language in both our individual lives and in wider society. He writes mainly about current uses of both English and Spanish and while not doing so is either preparing breakfasts, scouring for flight deals or informing those who will listen about his new favourite female singer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXNoKadmV6YvK57waWmoGeVo3yjsdKtZKmZo6i2t7GMmp6gqpWowKrCxGanoaqRqLK0ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-15-of-the-most-beautiful-celebrities-over-40-look-like-according-to-ordinary-women-801692.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What 15 of the Most Beautiful Celebrities Over 40 Look Like, According to Ordinary Women</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-jonas-brothers-reflect-on-their-break-up-say-theyre-better-now-than-ever.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Jonas Brothers Reflect on Their Break-Up, Say They're Better Now Than Ever</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

Four in 5 Trump-backers said they were angry following the July 13 shooting, compared with 37% of Biden backers, suggesting the matter could be highly motivating for the former president given the <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>past electoral power of the emotion</a>.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Awareness of events</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">News of Trump’s attempted assassination had the highest immediate salience of any event we have tested so far this year, with 2 in 3 voters reporting that they had seen, read or heard “a lot” about it by Monday.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The bulk of the electorate also reported hearing a lot about a bloodied Trump pumping his fist and leading a chant of “fight” as he was escorted off the Pennsylvania stage by U.S. Secret Service agents (56%), including nearly 2 in 3 Republicans.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Fewer voters heard a lot about Biden’s Oval Office address, where he called on Americans to reject political violence after directing his administration to conduct a review of the security failure at Trump’s rally, but he’s still getting good marks for his handling of the matter.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">A majority of voters (58%), including more than a third of Trump supporters, approve of Biden’s handling of Trump’s attempted assassination, nearly identical to the share of those who approve of Trump’s own response to his attack.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Fewer voters (49%) approve of how the Secret Service has responded to the events, with Trump’s backers almost evenly divided on the matter amid questions about how a gunman was able to get so close to their chosen candidate.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">As online conspiracies swirl about the question, a not-insignificant share of voters appear to be dabbling in theories of a ruse. And contrary to many others, this one appears largely driven by Biden’s supporters.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Roughly 1 in 5 voters said they find it credible that the shooting was staged and not intended to kill Trump, including a third of Biden’s supporters and 12% of those who back Trump.&nbsp; The majority of voters (62%) said the unsubstantiated notion is not credible as the Biden administration works to investigate the matter in advance of a public report as promised by the president.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>The bottom line</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The political impact of the latest dramatic, historic moment in American politics will take time to play out: Our latest quick-turn survey found similar numbers to <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>our daily tracking</a> of the contest over the weekend, which showed Trump maintaining a slight advantage over Biden.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But our latest survey makes one thing clear: The electorate is fearful of more violence, and blames the way politicians — and indeed Trump, a victim of the latest political violence — are talking about it. This signals voters’ desire for politicians to turn down the heat on each other, even if fear and anger continue to work and motivate them to show up at the polls.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX6m%2FtrnPZpisq5GowKq6wK2gqKZdlsG1scypq2aon6G5qrrG</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./vevo-exclusive-data-gen-z-music-videos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Vevo Data Reveals How Often Gen Z Watches Music Videos and Which Ones Overperform With Them</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-best-traditional-german-clothing.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Traditional German Clothing Explained - Lingoda</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.

Loki</h3><p class=align-left>Loki was the notorious trickster god in Norse mythology. He was Odin's brother and endured a mixed relationship with the Aesir clan. Loki possesses shape-shifting abilities, which enable his trickery. He is famous for being involved in Balder's death, which sets the stage for the cataclysm foretold in Ragnarok.</p><h3 id=1607009-10-balder class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>10.

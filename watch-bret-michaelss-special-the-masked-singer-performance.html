To amplify the fun, Michaels gave a special performance.</p><p>Wearing his signature red bandana, Michaels belted out his smash hit when he was still the frontman of Poison, “Nothin’ But a Good Time.” The rock musician energetically performed the song, jumping up and down as the crowd went wild. The spirit of the stage was further fired up through the flames on the screens in the background.</p><p>“Thank you for having me back,” he said after his performance. “Thank you, judges, I love you. Best night of my life.”</p><p>Michaels first appeared on The Masked Singer season three as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Banana</a>. During that time, the “Fallen Angel” singer placed seventh, impressing the audience with his splendid renditions of “A Little Less Conversation” by Elvis Presley and “Achy Breaky Heart” by Billy Ray Cyrus. He also performed “Lean on Me” by Bill Withers, “Sweet Home Alabama” by Lynyrd Skynyrd, and “Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door” by Bob Dylan.</p><p>During the latest episode, viewers saw Husky and Tiki unmasked themselves. Husky is Ginuwine, while Tiki was Sebastian Bach. Panelist Nicole Scherzinger was able to guess both their identities right.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/UwcsFrSFU1k?si=UwiGrbvfHZ0C-wMJ</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-sees-his-journey-as-the-true-irony-of-his-life>He Sees His Journey as the “True Irony” of His Life</h2><p>Michaels is undeniably one of the most memorable contestants during season three of the show. Over a decade ago, he was hospitalized with a brain hemorrhage that almost left him dead. Interestingly, in a twist he didn’t expect, he had the unfortunate event’s anniversary on the night he sang Bob Dylan’s “Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door” on the show, which marked his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">elimination</a>.</p><p>In May 2020, Michaels talked to People, hailing the show as the springboard of the irony of his life. With his successful journey, the musician said he’s extremely “grateful.”</p><p>“I celebrate the anniversary as being on the good side of the dirt and surviving. I don’t ever celebrate the brain hemorrhage. But how ironic that it is literally 10 years to the moment when the show airs, it was airing at the exact time that they were operating at night on my brain,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p><p>Reflecting on the adversity, he recalled promising himself to live to the fullest.</p><p>“As painful as this experience has been, I was given a second chance, right? I don’t want to sit around every night worrying this is going to happen again,” he said.</p><p>Since his brain hemorrhage, he decided to maintain a “go for it” mindset. This mantra triggered him to do The Masked Singer.</p><p>“I would have done anything to get here. This is the most awesome show. I’ve never had such a great time,” he said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Original_SofiaVergaraRedCarpet_Steve-GranitzFilmMagic-220x147.jpeg alt="Sofia Vergara Sued by Los Angeles Contractors Over Alleged Unpaid Bills for Home Renovations" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>bret michaels</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571pqrnKBdl7%2BmwIymoJygkZq5tL%2BMrKeem5mWuW7Ax55kppmjoLKledKipaCdomK9pr7FqKmmmZ6YsnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./which-are-the-most-spoken-languages-in-france.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What are the most spoken languages in France?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1474301-trey-makais-biography-age-height-birthday-parents-siblings.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Trey Makais biography: age, height, birthday, parents, siblings</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-pro-ezra-sosa-joins-jojo-siwas-upcoming-tour.html>'Dancing with the Stars' Pro Ezra Sosa Joins JoJo Siwa's Upcoming Tour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./it-makes-me-happy-cher-openly-shares-her-views-on-plastic-surgery-812380.html>&amp;quot;Men My Age Just Dont Like Me Cher Openly Shares Her Unique Views on Aging</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-with-special-features-that-actually-make-them-one-of-a-kind-804501.html>10 Celebrities With Special Features That Actually Make Them One of a Kind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-movie-villains-nobody-even-remembers-as-young-and-harmless-797569.html>10 Movie Villains Nobody Even Remembers as Young and Harmless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1405530-strong-female-names-meanings-give-child-html.html>100+ strong female names and meanings to give to your child</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash.
